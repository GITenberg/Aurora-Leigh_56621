constantly recurring in this poem, the last pages of which have been
finished under the hospitality of your roof, my own dearest cousin and
friend;—cousin and friend, in a sense of less equality and greater
disinterestedness than ‘Romney’’s.</p>

<p>Ending, therefore, and preparing once more to quit England, I venture
to leave in your hands this book, the most mature of my works, and the
one into which my highest convictions upon Life and Art have entered:
that as, through my various efforts in literature and steps in life,
you have believed in me, borne with me, and been generous to me, far
beyond the common uses of mere relationship or sympathy of mind, so you
may kindly accept, in sight of the public, this poor sign of esteem,
gratitude, and affection, from</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Of</span> writing many books there is no end;</span>
<span class="i0">And I who have written much in prose and verse</span>
<span class="i0">For others’ uses, will write now for mine,—</span>
<span class="i0">Will write my story for my better self,</span>
<span class="i0">As when you paint your portrait for a friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Who keeps it in a drawer and looks at it</span>
<span class="i0">Long after he has ceased to love you, just</span>
<span class="i0">To hold together what he was and is.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I, writing thus, am still what men call young;</span>
<span class="i0">I have not so far left the coasts of life</span>
<span class="i0">To travel inland, that I cannot hear</span>
<span class="i0">That murmur of the outer Infinite</span>
<span class="i0">Which unweaned babies smile at in their sleep</span>
<span class="i0">When wondered at for smiling; not so far,</span>
<span class="i0">But still I catch my mother at her post</span>
<span class="i0">Beside the nursery-door, with finger up,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Hush, hush—here’s too much noise!’ while her sweet eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Leap forward, taking part against her word</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In the child’s riot. Still I sit and feel</span>
<span class="i0">My father’s slow hand, when she had left us both,</span>
<span class="i0">Stroke out my childish curls across his knee;</span>
<span class="i0">And hear Assunta’s daily jest (she knew</span>
<span class="i0">He liked it better than a better jest)</span>
<span class="i0">Inquire how many golden scudi went</span>
<span class="i0">To make such ringlets. O my father’s hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Stroke the poor hair down, stroke it heavily,—</span>
<span class="i0">Draw, press the child’s head closer to thy knee!</span>
<span class="i0">I’m still too young, too young, to sit alone.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I write. My mother was a Florentine,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose rare blue eyes were shut from seeing me</span>
<span class="i0">When scarcely I was four years old; my life,</span>
<span class="i0">A poor spark snatched up from a failing lamp</span>
<span class="i0">Which went out therefore. She was weak and frail;</span>
<span class="i0">She could not bear the joy of giving life—</span>
<span class="i0">The mother’s rapture slew her. If her kiss</span>
<span class="i0">Had left a longer weight upon my lips,</span>
<span class="i0">It might have steadied the uneasy breath,</span>
<span class="i0">And reconciled and fraternised my soul</span>
<span class="i0">With the new order. As it was, indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">I felt a mother-want about the world,</span>
<span class="i0">And still went seeking, like a bleating lamb</span>
<span class="i0">Left out at night, in shutting up the fold,—</span>
<span class="i0">As restless as a nest-deserted bird</span>
<span class="i0">Grown chill through something being away, though what</span>
<span class="i0">It knows not. I, Aurora Leigh, was born</span>
<span class="i0">To make my father sadder, and myself</span>
<span class="i0">Not overjoyous, truly. Women know</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The way to rear up children, (to be just,)</span>
<span class="i0">They know a simple, merry, tender knack</span>
<span class="i0">Of tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes,</span>
<span class="i0">And stringing pretty words that make no sense,</span>
<span class="i0">And kissing full sense into empty words;</span>
<span class="i0">Which things are corals to cut life upon,</span>
<span class="i0">Although such trifles: children learn by such,</span>
<span class="i0">Love’s holy earnest in a pretty play,</span>
<span class="i0">And get not over-early solemnised,—</span>
<span class="i0">But seeing, as in a rose-bush, Love’s Divine,</span>
<span class="i0">Which burns and hurts not,—not a single bloom,—</span>
<span class="i0">Become aware and unafraid of Love.</span>
<span class="i0">Such good do mothers. Fathers love as well</span>
<span class="i0">—Mine did, I know,—but still with heavier brains,</span>
<span class="i0">And wills more consciously responsible,</span>
<span class="i0">And not as wisely, since less foolishly;</span>
<span class="i0">So mothers have God’s licence to be missed.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My father was an austere Englishman,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, after a dry life-time spent at home</span>
<span class="i0">In college-learning, law, and parish talk,</span>
<span class="i0">Was flooded with a passion unaware,</span>
<span class="i0">His whole provisioned and complacent past</span>
<span class="i0">Drowned out from him that moment. As he stood</span>
<span class="i0">In Florence, where he had come to spend a month</span>
<span class="i0">And note the secret of Da Vinci’s drains,</span>
<span class="i0">He musing somewhat absently perhaps</span>
<span class="i0">Some English question ... whether men should pay</span>
<span class="i0">The unpopular but necessary tax</span>
<span class="i0">With left or right hand—in the alien sun</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In that great square of the Santissima,</span>
<span class="i0">There drifted past him (scarcely marked enough</span>
<span class="i0">To move his comfortable island-scorn,)</span>
<span class="i0">A train of priestly banners, cross and psalm,—</span>
<span class="i0">The white-veiled rose-crowned maidens holding up</span>
<span class="i0">Tall tapers, weighty for such wrists, aslant</span>
<span class="i0">To the blue luminous tremor of the air,</span>
<span class="i0">And letting drop the white wax as they went</span>
<span class="i0">To eat the bishop’s wafer at the church;</span>
<span class="i0">From which long trail of chanting priests and girls,</span>
<span class="i0">A face flashed like a cymbal on his face,</span>
<span class="i0">And shook with silent clangour brain and heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Transfiguring him to music. Thus, even thus,</span>
<span class="i0">He too received his sacramental gift</span>
<span class="i0">With eucharistic meanings; for he loved.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus beloved, she died. I’ve heard it said</span>
<span class="i0">That but to see him in the first surprise</span>
<span class="i0">Of widower and father, nursing me,</span>
<span class="i0">Unmothered little child of four years old,</span>
<span class="i0">His large man’s hands afraid to touch my curls,</span>
<span class="i0">As if the gold would tarnish,—his grave lips</span>
<span class="i0">Contriving such a miserable smile,</span>
<span class="i0">As if he knew needs must, or I should die,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet ’twas hard,—would almost make the stones</span>
<span class="i0">Cry out for pity. There’s a verse he set</span>
<span class="i0">In Santa Croce to her memory,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Weep for an infant too young to weep much</span>
<span class="i0">When death removed this mother’—stops the mirth</span>
<span class="i0">To-day, on women’s faces when they walk</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With rosy children hanging on their gowns,</span>
<span class="i0">Under the cloister, to escape the sun</span>
<span class="i0">That scorches in the piazza. After which,</span>
<span class="i0">He left our Florence, and made haste to hide</span>
<span class="i0">Himself, his prattling child, and silent grief,</span>
<span class="i0">Among the mountains above Pelago;</span>
<span class="i0">Because unmothered babes, he thought, had need</span>
<span class="i0">Of mother nature more than others use,</span>
<span class="i0">And Pan’s white goats, with udders warm and full</span>
<span class="i0">Of mystic contemplations, come to feed</span>
<span class="i0">Poor milkless lips of orphans like his own—</span>
<span class="i0">Such scholar-scraps he talked, I’ve heard from friends,</span>
<span class="i0">For even prosaic men, who wear grief long,</span>
<span class="i0">Will get to wear it as a hat aside</span>
<span class="i0">With a flower stuck in’t. Father, then, and child,</span>
<span class="i0">We lived among the mountains many years,</span>
<span class="i0">God’s silence on the outside of the house,</span>
<span class="i0">And we, who did not speak too loud, within;</span>
<span class="i0">And old Assunta to make up the fire,</span>
<span class="i0">Crossing herself whene’er a sudden flame</span>
<span class="i0">Which lightened from the firewood, made alive</span>
<span class="i0">That picture of my mother on the wall.</span>
<span class="i0">The painter drew it after she was dead;</span>
<span class="i0">And when the face was finished, throat and hands,</span>
<span class="i0">Her cameriera carried him, in hate</span>
<span class="i0">Of the English-fashioned shroud, the last brocade</span>
<span class="i0">She dressed in at the Pitti. ‘He should paint</span>
<span class="i0">No sadder thing than that,’ she swore, ‘to wrong</span>
<span class="i0">Her poor signora.’ Therefore very strange</span>
<span class="i0">The effect was. I, a little child, would crouch</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For hours upon the floor, with knees drawn up,</span>
<span class="i0">And gaze across them, half in terror, half</span>
<span class="i0">In adoration, at the picture there,—</span>
<span class="i0">That swan-like supernatural white life,</span>
<span class="i0">Just sailing upward from the red stiff silk</span>
<span class="i0">Which seemed to have no part in it, nor power</span>
<span class="i0">To keep it from quite breaking out of bounds:</span>
<span class="i0">For hours I sate and stared. Assunta’s awe</span>
<span class="i0">And my poor father’s melancholy eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Still pointed that way. That way, went my thoughts</span>
<span class="i0">When wandering beyond sight. And as I grew</span>
<span class="i0">In years, I mixed, confused, unconsciously,</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever I last read or heard or dreamed,</span>
<span class="i0">Abhorrent, admirable, beautiful,</span>
<span class="i0">Pathetical, or ghastly, or grotesque,</span>
<span class="i0">With still that face ... which did not therefore change,</span>
<span class="i0">But kept the mystic level of all forms</span>
<span class="i0">And fears and admirations; was by turns</span>
<span class="i0">Ghost, fiend, and angel, fairy, witch, and sprite,—</span>
<span class="i0">A dauntless Muse who eyes a dreadful Fate,</span>
<span class="i0">A loving Psyche who loses sight of Love,</span>
<span class="i0">A still Medusa, with mild milky brows</span>
<span class="i0">All curdled and all clothed upon with snakes</span>
<span class="i0">Whose slime falls fast as sweat will; or, anon,</span>
<span class="i0">Our Lady of the Passion, stabbed with swords</span>
<span class="i0">Where the Babe sucked; or, Lamia in her first</span>
<span class="i0">Moonlighted pallor, ere she shrunk and blinked,</span>
<span class="i0">And, shuddering, wriggled down to the unclean;</span>
<span class="i0">Or, my own mother, leaving her last smile</span>
<span class="i0">In her last kiss, upon the baby-mouth</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My father pushed down on the bed for that,—</span>
<span class="i0">Or my dead mother, without smile or kiss,</span>
<span class="i0">Buried at Florence. All which images,</span>
<span class="i0">Concentred on the picture, glassed themselves</span>
<span class="i0">Before my meditative childhood, ... as</span>
<span class="i0">The incoherencies of change and death</span>
<span class="i0">Are represented fully, mixed and merged,</span>
<span class="i0">In the smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And while I stared away my childish wits</span>
<span class="i0">Upon my mother’s picture, (ah, poor child!)</span>
<span class="i0">My father, who through love had suddenly</span>
<span class="i0">Thrown off the old conventions, broken loose</span>
<span class="i0">From chin-bands of the soul, like Lazarus,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet had no time to learn to talk and walk</span>
<span class="i0">Or grow anew familiar with the sun,—</span>
<span class="i0">Who had reached to freedom, not to action, lived,</span>
<span class="i0">But lived as one entranced, with thoughts, not aims,—</span>
<span class="i0">Whom love had unmade from a common man</span>
<span class="i0">But not completed to an uncommon man,—</span>
<span class="i0">My father taught me what he had learnt the best</span>
<span class="i0">Before he died and left me,—grief and love.</span>
<span class="i0">And, seeing we had books among the hills,</span>
<span class="i0">Strong words of counselling souls, confederate</span>
<span class="i0">With vocal pines and waters,—out of books</span>
<span class="i0">He taught me all the ignorance of men,</span>
<span class="i0">And how God laughs in heaven when any man</span>
<span class="i0">Says ‘Here I’m learned; this, I understand;</span>
<span class="i0">In that, I am never caught at fault or doubt.’</span>
<span class="i0">He sent the schools to school, demonstrating</span>

<span class="i27">I am like,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, nine full years, our days were hid with God</span>
<span class="i0">Among his mountains. I was just thirteen,</span>
<span class="i0">Still growing like the plants from unseen roots</span>
<span class="i0">In tongue-tied Springs,—and suddenly awoke</span>
<span class="i0">To full life and its needs and agonies,</span>
<span class="i0">With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside</span>
<span class="i0">A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death,</span>
<span class="i0">Makes awful lightning. His last word was, ‘Love—’</span>
<span class="i0">‘Love, my child, love, love!’—(then he had done with grief)</span>
<span class="i0">‘Love, my child.’ Ere I answered he was gone,</span>
<span class="i0">And none was left to love in all the world.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There, ended childhood: what succeeded next</span>
<span class="i0">I recollect as, after fevers, men</span>

<span class="i0">I do remember clearly, how there came</span>
<span class="i0">A stranger with authority, not right,</span>
<span class="i0">(I thought not) who commanded, caught me up</span>
<span class="i0">From old Assunta’s neck; how, with a shriek,</span>
<span class="i0">She let me go,—while I, with ears too full</span>
<span class="i0">Of my father’s silence, to shriek back a word,</span>
<span class="i0">In all a child’s astonishment at grief</span>

<span class="i0">For kings to walk on, or our senators,</span>
<span class="i0">The poet suddenly will catch them up</span>
<span class="i0">With his voice like a thunder ... ‘This is soul,</span>
<span class="i0">This is life, this word is being said in heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s God down on us! what are you about?’</span>
<span class="i0">How all those workers start amid their work,</span>
<span class="i0">Look round, look up, and feel, a moment’s space,</span>
<span class="i0">That carpet-dusting, though a pretty trade,</span>
<span class="i0">Is not the imperative labour after all.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">In those days, though, I never analysed</span>

<span class="i0">And drop before the wonder of’t; you miss</span>
<span class="i0">The form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days,</span>

<span class="i0">My heart beat in my brain. Life’s violent flood</span>

<span class="i0">Mere lifeless imitations of live verse,</span>
<span class="i0">And made the living answer for the dead,</span>

<span class="i0">From such white heats!—bucolics, where the cows</span>
<span class="i0">Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud</span>
<span class="i0">In lashing off the flies,—didactics, driven</span>
<span class="i0">Against the heels of what the master said;</span>
<span class="i0">And counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps</span>
<span class="i0">A babe might blow between two straining cheeks</span>
<span class="i0">Of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh;</span>

<span class="i0">That leaps for love, is active for resolve,</span>
<span class="i0">Weak for art only. Oft, the ancient forms</span>

<span class="i0">The wine-skins, now and then, a little warped,</span>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Times</span> followed one another. Came a morn</span>
<span class="i0">I stood upon the brink of twenty years,</span>
<span class="i0">And looked before and after, as I stood</span>
<span class="i0">Woman and artist,—either incomplete,</span>
<span class="i0">Both credulous of completion. There I held</span>
<span class="i0">The whole creation in my little cup,</span>
<span class="i0">And smiled with thirsty lips before I drank,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Good health to you and me, sweet neighbour mine,</span>
<span class="i0">And all these peoples.’</span>
<span class="i20">I was glad, that day;</span>
<span class="i0">The June was in me, with its multitudes</span>
<span class="i0">Of nightingales all singing in the dark,</span>
<span class="i0">And rosebuds reddening where the calyx split.</span>
<span class="i0">I felt so young, so strong, so sure of God!</span>
<span class="i0">So glad, I could not choose be very wise!</span>
<span class="i0">And, old at twenty, was inclined to pull</span>
<span class="i0">My childhood backward in a childish jest</span>
<span class="i0">To see the face of’t once more, and farewell!</span>
<span class="i0">In which fantastic mood I bounded forth</span>
<span class="i0">At early morning,—would not wait so long</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As even to snatch my bonnet by the strings,</span>
<span class="i0">But, brushing a green trail across the lawn</span>
<span class="i0">With my gown in the dew, took will and way</span>
<span class="i0">Among the acacias of the shrubberies,</span>
<span class="i0">To fly my fancies in the open air</span>
<span class="i0">And keep my birthday, till my aunt awoke</span>
<span class="i0">To stop good dreams. Meanwhile I murmured on,</span>
<span class="i0">As honeyed bees keep humming to themselves;</span>
<span class="i0">‘The worthiest poets have remained uncrowned</span>
<span class="i0">Till death has bleached their foreheads to the bone,</span>
<span class="i0">And so with me it must be, unless I prove</span>
<span class="i0">Unworthy of the grand adversity,—</span>
<span class="i0">And certainly I would not fail so much.</span>
<span class="i0">What, therefore, if I crown myself to-day</span>
<span class="i0">In sport, not pride, to learn the feel of it,</span>
<span class="i0">Before my brows be numb as Dante’s own</span>
<span class="i0">To all the tender pricking of such leaves?</span>
<span class="i0">Such leaves! what leaves?’</span>
<span class="i25">I pulled the branches down,</span>
<span class="i0">To choose from.</span>
<span class="i16">‘Not the bay! I choose no bay;</span>
<span class="i0">The fates deny us if we are overbold:</span>
<span class="i0">Nor myrtle—which means chiefly love; and love</span>

<span class="i0">So early o’ mornings. This verbena strains</span>
<span class="i0">The point of passionate fragrance; and hard by,</span>
<span class="i0">This guelder-rose, at far too slight a beck</span>
<span class="i0">Of the wind, will toss about her flower-apples.</span>

<span class="i0">But thinking of a wreath. Large leaves, smooth leaves,</span>
<span class="i0">Serrated like my vines, and half as green.</span>
<span class="i0">I like such ivy; bold to leap a height</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas strong to climb! as good to grow on graves</span>
<span class="i0">As twist about a thyrsus; pretty too,</span>
<span class="i0">(And that’s not ill) when twisted round a comb,’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus speaking to myself, half singing it,</span>
<span class="i0">Because some thoughts are fashioned like a bell</span>
<span class="i0">To ring with once being touched, I drew a wreath</span>
<span class="i0">Drenched, blinding me with dew, across my brow,</span>
<span class="i0">And fastening it behind so, ... turning faced</span>
<span class="i0">... My public!—cousin Romney—with a mouth</span>
<span class="i0">Twice graver than his eyes.</span>
<span class="i24">I stood there fixed—</span>
<span class="i0">My arms up, like the caryatid, sole</span>
<span class="i0">Of some abolished temple, helplessly</span>
<span class="i0">Persistent in a gesture which derides</span>
<span class="i0">A former purpose. Yet my blush was flame,</span>
<span class="i0">As if from flax, not stone.</span>
<span class="i24">‘Aurora Leigh,</span>

<span class="i22">Hand stretched out</span>
<span class="i0">I clasped, as shipwrecked men will clasp a hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Indifferent to the sort of palm. The tide</span>
<span class="i0">Had caught me at my pastime, writing down</span>
<span class="i0">My foolish name too near upon the sea</span>
<span class="i0">Which drowned me with a blush as foolish. ‘You,</span>

<span class="i12">The smile died out in his eyes</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And dropped upon his lips, a cold dead weight,</span>
<span class="i0">For just a moment.... ‘Here’s a book, I found!</span>
<span class="i0">No name writ on it—poems, by the form;</span>
<span class="i0">Some Greek upon the margin,—lady’s Greek,</span>
<span class="i0">Without the accents. Read it? Not a word.</span>
<span class="i0">I saw at once the thing had witchcraft in’t</span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the reading calls up dangerous spirits;</span>
<span class="i0">I rather bring it to the witch.’</span>

<span class="i17">With a glance</span>
<span class="i0">The smile rose in his eyes again, and touched</span>
<span class="i0">The ivy on my forehead, light as air.</span>
<span class="i0">I answered gravely, ‘Poets needs must be</span>

<span class="i31">‘Ah,</span>

<span class="i0">I choose to walk at all risks.—Here, if heads</span>

<span class="i13">Saying which, I loosed my wreath,</span>

<span class="i0">We paced, until, just coming into sight</span>
<span class="i0">Of the house-windows, he abruptly caught</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Your cause is noble, your ends excellent,</span>

<span class="i0">Your social theory. Bless you both, I say.</span>
<span class="i0">For my part, I am scarcely meek enough</span>

<span class="i0">‘You misconceive the question like a man,</span>

<span class="i0">That every creature, female as the male,</span>
<span class="i0">Stands single in responsible act and thought,</span>

<span class="i0">To a loyal woman, ‘Love and work with me,’</span>
<span class="i0">Will get fair answers, if the work and love,</span>
<span class="i0">Being good themselves, are good for her—the best</span>

<span class="i0">To ask, ‘Who is it that cries after us,</span>
<span class="i0">Below there, in the dusk?’ Yet formerly</span>
<span class="i0">He turned his face upon me quick enough,</span>
<span class="i0">If I said ‘father.’ Now I might cry loud;</span>
<span class="i0">The little lark reached higher with his song</span>
<span class="i0">Than I with crying. Oh, alone, alone,—</span>
<span class="i0">Not troubling any in heaven, nor any on earth,</span>
<span class="i0">I stood there in the garden, and looked up</span>
<span class="i0">The deaf blue sky that brings the roses out</span>
<span class="i0">On such June mornings.</span>
<span class="i23">You who keep account</span>
<span class="i0">Of crisis and transition in this life,</span>
<span class="i0">Set down the first time Nature says plain ‘no’</span>
<span class="i0">To some ‘yes’ in you, and walks over you</span>
<span class="i0">In gorgeous sweeps of scorn. We all begin</span>
<span class="i0">By singing with the birds, and running fast</span>
<span class="i0">With June-days, hand in hand: but once, for all,</span>
<span class="i0">The birds must sing against us, and the sun</span>
<span class="i0">Strike down upon us like a friend’s sword caught</span>
<span class="i0">By an enemy to slay us, while we read</span>
<span class="i0">The dear name on the blade which bites at us!—</span>
<span class="i0">That’s bitter and convincing: after that,</span>
<span class="i0">We seldom doubt that something in the large</span>
<span class="i0">Smooth order of creation, though no more</span>
<span class="i0">Than haply a man’s footstep, has gone wrong.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some tears fell down my cheeks, and then I smiled,</span>

<span class="i0">As those smile who have no face in the world</span>
<span class="i0">To smile back to them. I had lost a friend</span>
<span class="i0">In Romney Leigh; the thing was sure—a friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Who had looked at me most gently now and then,</span>
<span class="i0">And spoken of my favourite books ... ‘our books’ ...</span>
<span class="i0">With such a voice! Well, voice and look were now</span>
<span class="i0">More utterly shut out from me, I felt,</span>
<span class="i0">Than even my father’s. Romney now was turned</span>
<span class="i0">To a benefactor, to a generous man,</span>
<span class="i0">Who had tied himself to marry ... me, instead</span>
<span class="i0">Of such a woman, with low timorous lids</span>
<span class="i0">He lifted with a sudden word one day,</span>
<span class="i0">And left, perhaps, for my sake.—Ah, self-tied</span>
<span class="i0">By a contract,—male Iphigenia, bound</span>
<span class="i0">At a fatal Aulis, for the winds to change,</span>
<span class="i0">(But loose him—they’ll not change); he well might seem</span>
<span class="i0">A little cold and dominant in love!</span>
<span class="i0">He had a right to be dogmatical,</span>
<span class="i0">This poor, good Romney. Love, to him, was made</span>
<span class="i0">A simple law-clause. If I married him,</span>
<span class="i0">I would not dare to call my soul my own,</span>
<span class="i0">Which so he had bought and paid for: every thought</span>
<span class="i0">And every heart-beat down there in the bill,—</span>
<span class="i0">Not one found honestly deductible</span>
<span class="i0">From any use that pleased him! He might cut</span>
<span class="i0">My body into coins to give away</span>
<span class="i0">Among his other paupers; change my sons,</span>
<span class="i0">While I stood dumb as Griseld, for black babes</span>

<span class="i0">My left hand washing in the Public Baths,</span>
<span class="i0">What time my angel of the Ideal stretched</span>
<span class="i0">Both his to me in vain! I could not claim</span>
<span class="i0">The poor right of a mouse in a trap, to squeal,</span>
<span class="i0">And take so much as pity, from myself.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Through the intermittent pantings. Being observed,</span>
<span class="i0">When observation is not sympathy,</span>
<span class="i0">Is just being tortured. If she said a word,</span>
<span class="i0">A ‘thank you,’ or an ‘if it please you, dear,’</span>
<span class="i0">She meant a commination, or, at best,</span>
<span class="i0">An exorcism against the devildom</span>

<span class="i0">Are nobler still, my cousin; and, I own,</span>
<span class="i0">The proudest and most delicate heart alive,</span>
<span class="i0">Distracted from the measure of the gift</span>

<span class="i0">The point we come to. Here’s a proof of gift,</span>

<span class="i0">The paper up and down, and down and up</span>

<span class="i0">I’m writing like a poet, somewhat large</span>
<span class="i0">In the type of the image,—and exaggerate</span>
<span class="i0">A small thing with a great thing, topping it!—</span>
<span class="i0">But then I’m thinking how his eyes looked ... his,</span>
<span class="i0">With what despondent and surprised reproach!</span>
<span class="i0">I think the tears were in them, as he looked—</span>
<span class="i0">I think the manly mouth just trembled. Then</span>
<span class="i0">He broke the silence.</span>
<span class="i17">‘I may ask, perhaps,</span>

<span class="i0">Such work I have for doing, elbow-deep</span>

<span class="i0">Yet He can pluck us from that shameful cross.</span>

<span class="i0">Blanche Ord, the writer in the ‘Lady’s Fan,’</span>
<span class="i0">Requests my judgment on ... that, afterwards.</span>
<span class="i0">Kate Ward desires the model of my cloak,</span>
<span class="i0">And signs, ‘Elisha to you.’ Pringle Sharpe</span>
<span class="i0">Presents his work on ‘Social Conduct,’ ... craves</span>
<span class="i0">A little money for his pressing debts ...</span>
<span class="i0">From me, who scarce have money for my needs,—</span>
<span class="i0">Art’s fiery chariot which we journey in</span>
<span class="i0">Being apt to singe our singing-robes to holes,</span>
<span class="i0">Although you ask me for my cloak, Kate Ward!</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s Rudgely knows it,—editor and scribe—</span>
<span class="i0">He’s ‘forced to marry where his heart is not,</span>
<span class="i0">Because the purse lacks where he lost his heart.’</span>
<span class="i0">Ah,—— lost it because no one picked it up!</span>
<span class="i0">That’s really loss! (and passable impudence.)</span>
<span class="i0">My critic Hammond flatters prettily,</span>
<span class="i0">And wants another volume like the last.</span>
<span class="i0">My critic Belfair wants another book</span>
<span class="i0">Entirely different, which will sell, (and live?)</span>
<span class="i0">A striking book, yet not a startling book,</span>

<span class="i0">And yet a revelation in some sort:</span>
<span class="i0">That’s hard, my critic Belfair! So—what next?</span>
<span class="i0">My critic Stokes objects to abstract thoughts;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Call a man, John, a woman, Joan,’ says he,</span>
<span class="i0">‘And do not prate so of humanities:’</span>
<span class="i0">Whereat I call my critic, simply Stokes.</span>
<span class="i0">My critic Jobson recommends more mirth,</span>
<span class="i0">Because a cheerful genius suits the times,</span>
<span class="i0">And all true poets laugh unquenchably</span>
<span class="i0">Like Shakspeare and the gods. That’s very hard.</span>
<span class="i0">The gods may laugh, and Shakspeare; Dante smiled</span>
<span class="i0">With such a needy heart on two pale lips,</span>
<span class="i0">We cry, ‘Weep rather, Dante.’ Poems are</span>
<span class="i0">Men, if true poems: and who dares exclaim</span>
<span class="i0">At any man’s door, ’Here, ’tis probable</span>
<span class="i0">The thunder fell last week, and killed a wife,</span>
<span class="i0">And scared a sickly husband—what of that?</span>
<span class="i0">Get up, be merry, shout, and clap your hands,</span>
<span class="i0">Because a cheerful genius suits the times—’?</span>
<span class="i0">None says so to the man,—and why indeed</span>

<span class="i0">She lies here—flat upon her prison-floor,</span>

<span class="i0">Like wet sea-weed. You dimly see her through</span>
<span class="i0">The glittering haze of that prodigious rain,</span>

<span class="i0">Fog only, the great tawny weltering fog,</span>
<span class="i0">Involve the passive city, strangle it</span>
<span class="i0">Alive, and draw it off into the void,</span>
<span class="i0">Spires, bridges, streets, and squares, as if a spunge</span>

<span class="i0">Had clapped together and utterly struck out</span>
<span class="i0">The intermediate time, undoing themselves</span>
<span class="i0">In the act. Your city poets see such things,</span>
<span class="i0">Not despicable. Mountains of the south,</span>

<span class="i0">But sit in London, at the day’s decline,</span>

<span class="i0">Like Pharaoh’s armaments in the deep Red Sea,—</span>

<span class="i0">We plant the graveyards with them.</span>
<span class="i30">Day and night</span>
<span class="i0">I worked my rhythmic thought, and furrowed up</span>
<span class="i0">Both watch and slumber with long lines of life</span>

<span class="i0">From either cheek, my eyes globed luminous</span>

<span class="i0">And said, ‘You work too much, you are looking ill,’</span>
<span class="i0">I smiled for pity of them who pitied me,</span>

<span class="i0">In England, no one lives by verse that lives;</span>
<span class="i0">And, apprehending, I resolved by prose</span>
<span class="i0">To make a space to sphere my living verse.</span>
<span class="i0">I wrote for cyclopædias, magazines,</span>
<span class="i0">And weekly papers, holding up my name</span>

<span class="i0">And swept it grandly through the open doors</span>
<span class="i0">As if one could not pass through doors at all</span>

<span class="i0">To suit light readers,—something in the lines</span>

<span class="i23">Having bread</span>
<span class="i0">For just so many days, just breathing room</span>
<span class="i0">For body and verse, I stood up straight and worked</span>
<span class="i0">My veritable work. And as the soul</span>

<span class="i0">The critics cried out on the falling off,</span>

<span class="i0">And crosses out the spontaneities</span>
<span class="i0">Of all his individual, personal life,</span>
<span class="i0">With formal universals. As if man</span>

<span class="i0">Then live, Aurora!</span>
<span class="i17">Two hours afterward,</span>
<span class="i0">Within St. Margaret’s Court I stood alone,</span>

<span class="i0">Thin dangling locks, and flat lascivious mouth,</span>

<span class="i0">Our cholera catch you with its cramps and spasms,</span>

<span class="i0">I think I could have walked through hell that day,</span>
<span class="i0">And never flinched. ‘The dear Christ comfort you,’</span>
<span class="i0">I said, ‘you must have been most miserable</span>
<span class="i0">To be so cruel,’—and I emptied out</span>
<span class="i0">My purse upon the stones: when, as I had cast</span>
<span class="i0">The last charm in the cauldron, the whole court</span>
<span class="i0">Went boiling, bubbling up, from all its doors</span>
<span class="i0">And windows, with a hideous wail of laughs</span>
<span class="i0">And roar of oaths, and blows perhaps ... I passed</span>
<span class="i0">Too quickly for distinguishing ... and pushed</span>
<span class="i0">A little side-door hanging on a hinge,</span>
<span class="i0">And plunged into the dark, and groped and climbed</span>
<span class="i0">The long, steep, narrow stair ’twixt broken rail</span>
<span class="i0">And mildewed wall that let the plaster drop</span>
<span class="i0">To startle me in the blackness. Still, up, up!</span>
<span class="i0">So high lived Romney’s bride. I paused at last</span>
<span class="i0">Before a low door in the roof, and knocked;</span>
<span class="i0">There came an answer like a hurried dove—</span>
<span class="i0">‘So soon? can that be Mister Leigh? so soon?’</span>
<span class="i0">And as I entered, an ineffable face</span>
<span class="i0">Met mine upon the threshold. ‘Oh, not you,</span>
<span class="i0">Not you!’ ... the dropping of the voice implied,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Then, if not you, for me not any one.’</span>

<span class="i0">I looked her in the eyes, and held her hands,</span>
<span class="i0">And said, ‘I am his cousin,—Romney Leigh’s;</span>
<span class="i0">And here I’m come to see my cousin too.’</span>
<span class="i0">She touched me with her face and with her voice,</span>
<span class="i0">This daughter of the people. Such soft flowers,</span>

<span class="i0">The hair, too, ran its opulence of curls</span>
<span class="i0">In doubt ’twixt dark and bright, nor left you clear</span>

<span class="i0">Which seemed to droop on that side and on this,</span>

<span class="i0">With redder, fuller rounds: and somewhat large</span>
<span class="i0">The mouth was, though the milky little teeth</span>

<span class="i0">For soon it smiled at me; the eyes smiled too,</span>

<span class="i0">To wail in when she had come. No place for her,</span>
<span class="i0">By man’s law! born an outlaw, was this babe.</span>
<span class="i0">Her first cry in our strange and strangling air,</span>
<span class="i0">When cast in spasms out by the shuddering womb,</span>
<span class="i0">Was wrong against the social code,—forced wrong.</span>
<span class="i0">What business had the baby to cry there?</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I tell her story and grow passionate.</span>
<span class="i0">She, Marian, did not tell it so, but used</span>
<span class="i0">Meek words that made no wonder of herself</span>
<span class="i0">For being so sad a creature. ‘Mister Leigh</span>
<span class="i0">Considered truly that such things should change.</span>
<span class="i0">They <i>will</i>, in heaven—but meantime, on the earth,</span>
<span class="i0">There’s none can like a nettle as a pink,</span>
<span class="i0">Except himself. We’re nettles, some of us,</span>
<span class="i0">And give offence by the act of springing up;</span>
<span class="i0">And, if we leave the damp side of the wall,</span>
<span class="i0">The hoes, of course, are on us.’ So she said.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her father earned his life by random jobs</span>
<span class="i0">Despised by steadier workmen—keeping swine</span>
<span class="i0">On commons, picking hops, or hurrying on</span>
<span class="i0">The harvest at wet seasons,—or, at need,</span>
<span class="i0">Assisting the Welsh drovers, when a drove</span>
<span class="i0">Of startled horses plunged into the mist</span>
<span class="i0">Below the mountain-road, and sowed the wind</span>
<span class="i0">With wandering neighings. In between the gaps</span>
<span class="i0">Of such irregular work, he drank and slept,</span>
<span class="i0">And cursed his wife because, the pence being out,</span>
<span class="i0">She could not buy more drink. At which she turned,</span>
<span class="i0">(The worm) and beat her baby in revenge</span>
<span class="i0">For her own broken heart. There’s not a crime</span>
<span class="i0">But takes its proper change out still in crime,</span>
<span class="i0">If once rung on the counter of this world;</span>
<span class="i0">Let sinners look to it.</span>
<span class="i19">Yet the outcast child,</span>
<span class="i0">For whom the very mother’s face forewent</span>
<span class="i0">The mother’s special patience, lived and grew;</span>
<span class="i0">Learnt early to cry low, and walk alone,</span>
<span class="i0">With that pathetic vacillating roll</span>
<span class="i0">Of the infant body on the uncertain feet,</span>
<span class="i0">(The earth being felt unstable ground so soon)</span>
<span class="i0">At which most women’s arms unclose at once</span>
<span class="i0">With irrepressive instinct. Thus, at three,</span>
<span class="i0">This poor weaned kid would run off from the fold,</span>
<span class="i0">This babe would steal off from the mother’s chair,</span>
<span class="i0">And, creeping through the golden walls of gorse,</span>
<span class="i0">Would find some keyhole toward the secresy</span>
<span class="i0">Of Heaven’s high blue, and, nestling down, peer out—</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, not to catch the angels at their games,</span>
<span class="i0">She had never heard of angels,—but to gaze</span>
<span class="i0">She knew not why, to see she knew not what,</span>
<span class="i0">A-hungering outward from the barren earth</span>
<span class="i0">For something like a joy. She liked, she said,</span>
<span class="i0">To dazzle black her sight against the sky,</span>
<span class="i0">For then, it seemed, some grand blind Love came down,</span>
<span class="i0">And groped her out, and clasped her with a kiss;</span>
<span class="i0">She learnt God that way, and was beat for it</span>
<span class="i0">Whenever she went home,—yet came again,</span>
<span class="i0">As surely as the trapped hare, getting free,</span>
<span class="i0">Returns to his form. This grand blind Love, she said,</span>
<span class="i0">This skyey father and mother both in one,</span>
<span class="i0">Instructed her and civilised her more</span>
<span class="i0">Than even the Sunday-school did afterward,</span>
<span class="i0">To which a lady sent her to learn books</span>
<span class="i0">And sit upon a long bench in a row</span>
<span class="i0">With other children. Well, she laughed sometimes</span>
<span class="i0">To see them laugh and laugh, and moil their texts;</span>
<span class="i0">But ofter she was sorrowful with noise,</span>
<span class="i0">And wondered if their mothers beat them hard,</span>
<span class="i0">That ever they should laugh so. There was one</span>
<span class="i0">She loved indeed,—Rose Bell, a seven years’ child,</span>
<span class="i0">So pretty and clever, who read syllables</span>
<span class="i0">When Marian was at letters; <i>she</i> would laugh</span>
<span class="i0">At nothing—hold your finger up, she laughed,</span>
<span class="i0">Then shook her curls down on her eyes and mouth</span>
<span class="i0">To hide her make-mirth from the schoolmaster.</span>
<span class="i0">And Rose’s pelting glee, as frank as rain</span>
<span class="i0">On cherry-blossoms, brightened Marian too,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To see another merry whom she loved.</span>
<span class="i0">She whispered once (the children side by side,</span>
<span class="i0">With mutual arms entwined about their necks)</span>
<span class="i0">‘Your mother lets you laugh so?’ ‘Ay,’ said Rose,</span>
<span class="i0">‘She lets me. She was dug into the ground</span>
<span class="i0">Six years since, I being but a yearling wean.</span>
<span class="i0">Such mothers let us play and lose our time,</span>
<span class="i0">And never scold nor beat us! don’t you wish</span>
<span class="i0">You had one like that?’ There, Marian breaking off</span>
<span class="i0">Looked suddenly in my face. ‘Poor Rose,’ said she,</span>
<span class="i0">‘I heard her laugh last night in Oxford Street.</span>
<span class="i0">I’d pour out half my blood to stop that laugh,—</span>
<span class="i0">Poor Rose, poor Rose!’ said Marian.</span>
<span class="i30">She resumed.</span>
<span class="i0">It tried her, when she had learnt at Sunday-school</span>
<span class="i0">What God was, what he wanted from us all,</span>
<span class="i0">And how, in choosing sin, we vexed the Christ,</span>
<span class="i0">To go straight home and hear her father pull</span>
<span class="i0">The Name down on us from the thunder-shelf,</span>
<span class="i0">Then drink away his soul into the dark</span>
<span class="i0">From seeing judgment. Father, mother, home,</span>
<span class="i0">Were God and heaven reversed to her: the more</span>
<span class="i0">She knew of Right, the more she guessed their wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">Her price paid down for knowledge, was to know</span>
<span class="i0">The vileness of her kindred: through her heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Her filial and tormented heart, henceforth,</span>
<span class="i0">They struck their blows at virtue. Oh, ’tis hard</span>
<span class="i0">To learn you have a father up in heaven</span>
<span class="i0">By a gathering certain sense of being, on earth,</span>
<span class="i0">Still worse than orphaned: ’tis too heavy a grief,</span>

<span class="i0">The having to thank God for such a joy!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so passed Marian’s life from year to year.</span>
<span class="i0">Her parents took her with them when they tramped,</span>
<span class="i0">Dodged lanes and heaths, frequented towns and fairs,</span>
<span class="i0">And once went farther and saw Manchester,</span>
<span class="i0">And once the sea, that blue end of the world,</span>
<span class="i0">That fair scroll-finis of a wicked book,—</span>
<span class="i0">And twice a prison,—back at intervals,</span>
<span class="i0">Returning to the hills. Hills draw like heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">And stronger sometimes, holding out their hands</span>
<span class="i0">To pull you from the vile flats up to them;</span>
<span class="i0">And though, perhaps, these strollers still strolled back,</span>
<span class="i0">As sheep do, simply that they knew the way,</span>
<span class="i0">They certainly felt bettered unawares</span>
<span class="i0">Emerging from the social smut of towns</span>
<span class="i0">To wipe their feet clean on the mountain-turf.</span>
<span class="i0">In which long wanderings, Marian lived and learned,</span>
<span class="i0">Endured and learned. The people on the roads</span>
<span class="i0">Would stop and ask her how her eyes outgrew</span>
<span class="i0">Her cheeks, and if she meant to lodge the birds</span>
<span class="i0">In all that hair; and then they lifted her,</span>
<span class="i0">The miller in his cart, a mile or twain,</span>
<span class="i0">The butcher’s boy on horseback. Often, too,</span>
<span class="i0">The pedlar stopped, and tapped her on the head</span>
<span class="i0">With absolute forefinger, brown and ringed,</span>
<span class="i0">And asked if peradventure she could read;</span>
<span class="i0">And when she answered ‘ay,’ would toss her down</span>
<span class="i0">Some stray odd volume from his heavy pack,</span>
<span class="i0">A Thomson’s Seasons, mulcted of the Spring,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Or else a sheaf of leaves (for that small Ruth’s</span>
<span class="i0">Small gleanings) torn out from the heart of books,</span>
<span class="i0">From Churchyard Elegies and Edens Lost,</span>
<span class="i0">From Burns, and Bunyan, Selkirk, and Tom Jones.</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas somewhat hard to keep the things distinct,</span>
<span class="i0">And oft the jangling influence jarred the child</span>
<span class="i0">Like looking at a sunset full of grace</span>
<span class="i0">Through a pothouse window while the drunken oaths</span>
<span class="i0">Went on behind her; but she weeded out</span>
<span class="i0">Her book-leaves, threw away the leaves that hurt,</span>
<span class="i0">(First tore them small, that none should find a word)</span>
<span class="i0">And made a nosegay of the sweet and good</span>

<span class="i0">At broken moments of the noontide glare,</span>
<span class="i0">When leave was given her to untie her cloak</span>
<span class="i0">And rest upon the dusty roadside bank</span>
<span class="i0">From the highway’s dust. Or oft, the journey done,</span>
<span class="i0">Some city friend would lead her by the hand</span>
<span class="i0">To hear a lecture at an institute:</span>

<span class="i0">By any blow, or word even. Out-door jobs</span>
<span class="i0">Went ill with her; and household quiet work,</span>
<span class="i0">She was not born to. Had they kept the north,</span>

<span class="i0">One day, said Marian,—the sun shone that day—</span>
<span class="i0">Her mother had been badly beat, and felt</span>

<span class="i0">To think of me, and fix where I shall go?’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘So young,’ he gently asked her, ‘you have lost</span>
<span class="i0">Your father and your mother?’</span>
<span class="i25">‘Both,’ she said,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Both lost! my father was burnt up with gin</span>
<span class="i0">Or ever I sucked milk, and so is lost.</span>
<span class="i0">My mother sold me to a man last month,</span>
<span class="i0">And so my mother’s lost, ’tis manifest.</span>
<span class="i0">And I, who fled from her for miles and miles,</span>
<span class="i0">As if I had caught sight of the fires of hell</span>
<span class="i0">Through some wild gap, (she was my mother, sir)</span>
<span class="i0">It seems I shall be lost too, presently,</span>
<span class="i0">And so we end, all three of us.’</span>
<span class="i29">‘Poor child!’</span>
<span class="i0">He said,—with such a pity in his voice,</span>
<span class="i0">It soothed her more than her own tears,—‘poor child!</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis simple that betrayal by mother’s love</span>
<span class="i0">Should bring despair of God’s too. Yet be taught;</span>

<span class="i0">He’s better to us than many mothers are,</span>
<span class="i0">And children cannot wander beyond reach</span>
<span class="i0">Of the sweep of his white raiment. Touch and hold!</span>
<span class="i0">And if you weep still, weep where John was laid</span>
<span class="i0">While Jesus loved him.’</span>
<span class="i19">‘She could say the words,’</span>
<span class="i0">She told me, ‘exactly as he uttered them</span>
<span class="i0">A year back, ... since, in any doubt or dark,</span>
<span class="i0">They came out like the stars, and shone on her</span>
<span class="i0">With just their comfort. Common words, perhaps;</span>
<span class="i0">The ministers in church might say the same;</span>
<span class="i0">But <i>he</i>, he made the church with what he spoke,—</span>
<span class="i0">The difference was the miracle,’ said she.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then catching up her smile to ravishment,</span>
<span class="i0">She added quickly, ‘I repeat his words,</span>
<span class="i0">But not his tones: can any one repeat</span>
<span class="i0">The music of an organ, out of church?</span>
<span class="i0">And when he said ‘poor child,’ I shut my eyes</span>
<span class="i0">To feel how tenderly his voice broke through,</span>
<span class="i0">As the ointment-box broke on the Holy feet</span>
<span class="i0">To let out the rich medicative nard.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She told me how he had raised and rescued her</span>
<span class="i0">With reverent pity, as, in touching grief,</span>
<span class="i0">He touched the wounds of Christ,—and made her feel</span>
<span class="i0">More self-respecting. Hope, he called, belief</span>
<span class="i0">In God,—work, worship ... therefore let us pray!</span>
<span class="i0">And thus, to snatch her soul from atheism,</span>
<span class="i0">And keep it stainless from her mother’s face,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He sent her to a famous sempstress-house</span>
<span class="i0">Far off in London, there to work and hope.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With that, they parted. She kept sight of Heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">But not of Romney. He had good to do</span>
<span class="i0">To others: through the days and through the nights,</span>
<span class="i0">She sewed and sewed and sewed. She drooped sometimes,</span>
<span class="i0">And wondered, while, along the tawny light,</span>
<span class="i0">She struck the new thread into her needle’s eye,</span>
<span class="i0">How people, without mothers on the hills,</span>
<span class="i0">Could choose the town to live in!—then she drew</span>
<span class="i0">The stitch, and mused how Romney’s face would look,</span>
<span class="i0">And if ’twere likely he’d remember hers,</span>
<span class="i0">When they two had their meeting after death.</span>

<h2>FOURTH BOOK.</h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">They</span> met still sooner. ’Twas a year from thence</span>
<span class="i0">When Lucy Gresham, the sick sempstress girl,</span>
<span class="i0">Who sewed by Marian’s chair so still and quick,</span>
<span class="i0">And leant her head upon the back to cough</span>
<span class="i0">More freely when, the mistress turning round,</span>
<span class="i0">The others took occasion to laugh out,—</span>
<span class="i0">Gave up at last. Among the workers, spoke</span>
<span class="i0">A bold girl with black eyebrows and red lips,—</span>
<span class="i0">‘You know the news? Who’s dying, do you think?</span>
<span class="i0">Our Lucy Gresham. I expected it</span>
<span class="i0">As little as Nell Hart’s wedding. Blush not, Nell,</span>
<span class="i0">Thy curls be red enough without thy cheeks;</span>
<span class="i0">And, some day, there’ll be found a man to dote</span>
<span class="i0">On red curls.—Lucy Gresham swooned last night,</span>
<span class="i0">Dropped sudden in the street while going home;</span>
<span class="i0">And now the baker says, who took her up</span>
<span class="i0">And laid her by her grandmother in bed,</span>
<span class="i0">He’ll give her a week to die in. Pass the silk.</span>
<span class="i0">Let’s hope he gave her a loaf too, within reach,</span>
<span class="i0">For otherwise they’ll starve before they die,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That funny pair of bedfellows! Miss Bell,</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll thank you for the scissors. The old crone</span>
<span class="i0">Is paralytic—that’s the reason why</span>
<span class="i0">Our Lucy’s thread went faster than her breath,</span>
<span class="i0">Which went too quick, we all know. Marian Erle!</span>
<span class="i0">Why, Marian Erle, you’re not the fool to cry?</span>
<span class="i0">Your tears spoil Lady Waldemar’s new dress,</span>
<span class="i0">You piece of pity!’</span>
<span class="i20">Marian rose up straight,</span>
<span class="i0">And, breaking through the talk and through the work,</span>
<span class="i0">Went outward, in the face of their surprise,</span>
<span class="i0">To Lucy’s home, to nurse her back to life</span>
<span class="i0">Or down to death. She knew, by such an act,</span>
<span class="i0">All place and grace were forfeit in the house,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose mistress would supply the missing hand</span>
<span class="i0">With necessary, not inhuman haste,</span>
<span class="i0">And take no blame. But pity, too, had dues:</span>
<span class="i0">She could not leave a solitary soul</span>
<span class="i0">To founder in the dark, while she sate still</span>
<span class="i0">And lavished stitches on a lady’s hem</span>
<span class="i0">As if no other work were paramount.</span>
<span class="i0">‘Why, God,’ thought Marian, ‘has a missing hand</span>
<span class="i0">This moment; Lucy wants a drink, perhaps.</span>
<span class="i0">Let others miss me! never miss me, God!’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Marian sate by Lucy’s bed, content</span>
<span class="i0">With duty, and was strong, for recompense,</span>
<span class="i0">To hold the lamp of human love arm-high</span>
<span class="i0">To catch the death-strained eyes and comfort them,</span>
<span class="i0">Until the angels, on the luminous side</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of death, had got theirs ready. And she said,</span>
<span class="i0">When Lucy thanked her sometimes, called her kind,</span>
<span class="i0">It touched her strangely. ‘Marian Erle, called kind!</span>
<span class="i0">What, Marian, beaten and sold, who could not die!</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis verily good fortune to be kind.</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, you,’ she said, ‘who are born to such a grace,</span>
<span class="i0">Be sorry for the unlicensed class, the poor,</span>
<span class="i0">Reduced to think the best good fortune means</span>
<span class="i0">That others, simply, should be kind to them.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From sleep to sleep while Lucy slid away</span>
<span class="i0">So gently, like the light upon a hill,</span>
<span class="i0">Of which none names the moment that it goes,</span>
<span class="i0">Though all see when ’tis gone,—a man came in</span>
<span class="i0">And stood beside the bed. The old idiot wretch</span>
<span class="i0">Screamed feebly, like a baby overlain,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Sir, sir, you won’t mistake me for the corpse?</span>
<span class="i0">Don’t look at <i>me</i>, sir! never bury <i>me</i>!</span>
<span class="i0">Although I lie here, I’m alive as you,</span>
<span class="i0">Except my legs and arms,—I eat and drink,</span>
<span class="i0">And understand,—(that you’re the gentleman</span>
<span class="i0">Who fits the funerals up, Heaven speed you, sir,)</span>
<span class="i0">And certainly I should be livelier still</span>
<span class="i0">If Lucy here ... sir, Lucy is the corpse ...</span>
<span class="i0">Had worked more properly to buy me wine:</span>
<span class="i0">But Lucy, sir, was always slow at work,</span>
<span class="i0">I shan’t lose much by Lucy. Marian Erle,</span>
<span class="i0">Speak up and show the gentleman the corpse.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then a voice said, ‘Marian Erle.’ She rose;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
<span class="i0">It was the hour for angels—there, stood hers!</span>
<span class="i0">She scarcely marvelled to see Romney Leigh.</span>
<span class="i0">As light November snows to empty nests,</span>
<span class="i0">As grass to graves, as moss to mildewed stones,</span>
<span class="i0">As July suns to ruins, through the rents,</span>
<span class="i0">As ministering spirits to mourners, through a loss,</span>
<span class="i0">As Heaven itself to men, through pangs of death,</span>
<span class="i0">He came uncalled wherever grief had come.</span>
<span class="i0">‘And so,’ said Marian Erle, ‘we met anew,’</span>
<span class="i0">And added softly, ‘so, we shall not part.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was not angry that she had left the house</span>
<span class="i0">Wherein he placed her. Well—she had feared it might</span>
<span class="i0">Have vexed him. Also, when he found her set</span>
<span class="i0">On keeping, though the dead was out of sight,</span>
<span class="i0">That half-dead, half-live body left behind</span>
<span class="i0">With cankerous heart and flesh,—which took your best</span>
<span class="i0">And cursed you for the little good it did,</span>
<span class="i0">(Could any leave the bedrid wretch alone,</span>
<span class="i0">So joyless, she was thankless even to God,</span>
<span class="i0">Much less to you?) he did not say ’twas well,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet Marian thought he did not take it ill,—</span>
<span class="i0">Since day by day he came, and, every day,</span>
<span class="i0">She felt within his utterance and his eyes</span>
<span class="i0">A closer, tenderer presence of the soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Until at last he said, ‘We shall not part.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On that same day, was Marian’s work complete:</span>
<span class="i0">She had smoothed the empty bed, and swept the floor</span>
<span class="i0">Of coffin sawdust, set the chairs anew</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The dead had ended gossip in, and stood</span>
<span class="i0">In that poor room so cold and orderly,</span>
<span class="i0">The door-key in her hand, prepared to go</span>
<span class="i0">As <i>they</i> had, howbeit not their way. He spoke.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Dear Marian, of one clay God made us all,</span>
<span class="i0">And though men push and poke and paddle in’t</span>
<span class="i0">(As children play at fashioning dirt-pies)</span>
<span class="i0">And call their fancies by the name of facts,</span>
<span class="i0">Assuming difference, lordship, privilege,</span>
<span class="i0">When all’s plain dirt,—they come back to it at last;</span>
<span class="i0">The first grave-digger proves it with a spade,</span>
<span class="i0">And pats all even. Need we wait for this,</span>
<span class="i0">You, Marian, and I, Romney?’</span>
<span class="i28">She, at that,</span>
<span class="i0">Looked blindly in his face, as when one looks</span>
<span class="i0">Through driving autumn-rains to find the sky.</span>
<span class="i0">He went on speaking.</span>
<span class="i20">‘Marian, I being born</span>
<span class="i0">What men call noble, and you, issued from</span>
<span class="i0">The noble people,—though the tyrannous sword</span>
<span class="i0">Which pierced Christ’s heart, has cleft the world in twain</span>
<span class="i0">’Twixt class and class, opposing rich to poor,—</span>
<span class="i0">Shall <i>we</i> keep parted? Not so. Let us lean</span>
<span class="i0">And strain together rather, each to each,</span>
<span class="i0">Compress the red lips of this gaping wound,</span>
<span class="i0">As far as two souls can,—ay, lean and league,</span>
<span class="i0">I, from my superabundance,—from your want,</span>
<span class="i0">You,—joining in a protest ’gainst the wrong</span>
<span class="i0">On both sides!’—</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
<span class="i18">All the rest, he held her hand</span>
<span class="i0">In speaking, which confused the sense of much;</span>
<span class="i0">Her heart, against his words, beat out so thick,</span>
<span class="i0">They might as well be written on the dust</span>
<span class="i0">Where some poor bird, escaping from hawk’s beak,</span>
<span class="i0">Has dropped, and beats its shuddering wings,—the lines</span>
<span class="i0">Are rubbed so,—yet ’twas something like to this,</span>
<span class="i0">—‘That they two, standing at the two extremes</span>
<span class="i0">Of social classes, had received one seal,</span>
<span class="i0">Been dedicate and drawn beyond themselves</span>
<span class="i0">To mercy and ministration,—he, indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">Through what he knew, and she, through what she felt,</span>
<span class="i0">He, by man’s conscience, she, by woman’s heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Relinquishing their several ’vantage posts</span>
<span class="i0">Of wealthy ease and honourable toil,</span>
<span class="i0">To work with God at love. And, since God willed</span>
<span class="i0">That, putting out his hand to touch this ark,</span>
<span class="i0">He found a woman’s hand there, he’d accept</span>
<span class="i0">The sign too, hold the tender fingers fast,</span>
<span class="i0">And say, ‘My fellow-worker, be my wife!’’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She told the tale with simple, rustic turns,—</span>
<span class="i0">Strong leaps of meaning in her sudden eyes</span>
<span class="i0">That took the gaps of any imperfect phrase</span>
<span class="i0">Of the unschooled speaker: I have rather writ</span>
<span class="i0">The thing I understood so, than the thing</span>
<span class="i0">I heard so. And I cannot render right</span>
<span class="i0">Her quick gesticulation, wild yet soft,</span>
<span class="i0">Self-startled from the habitual mood she used,</span>
<span class="i0">Half sad, half languid,—like dumb creatures (now</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A rustling bird, and now a wandering deer,</span>
<span class="i0">Or squirrel against the oak-gloom flashing up</span>
<span class="i0">His sidelong burnished head, in just her way</span>
<span class="i0">Of savage spontaneity,) that stir</span>
<span class="i0">Abruptly the green silence of the woods,</span>
<span class="i0">And make it stranger, holier, more profound;</span>
<span class="i0">As Nature’s general heart confessed itself</span>
<span class="i0">Of life, and then fell backward on repose.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I kissed the lips that ended.—‘So indeed</span>
<span class="i0">He loves you, Marian?’</span>
<span class="i19">‘Loves me!’ She looked up</span>
<span class="i0">With a child’s wonder when you ask him first</span>
<span class="i0">Who made the sun—a puzzled blush, that grew,</span>
<span class="i0">Then broke off in a rapid radiant smile</span>
<span class="i0">Of sure solution. ‘Loves me! he loves all,—</span>
<span class="i0">And me, of course. He had not asked me else</span>
<span class="i0">To work with him for ever, and be his wife.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her words reproved me. This perhaps was love—</span>
<span class="i0">To have its hands too full of gifts to give,</span>
<span class="i0">For putting out a hand to take a gift;</span>
<span class="i0">To love so much, the perfect round of love</span>
<span class="i0">Includes, in strict conclusion, the being loved;</span>
<span class="i0">As Eden-dew went up and fell again,</span>
<span class="i0">Enough for watering Eden. Obviously</span>
<span class="i0">She had not thought about his love at all:</span>
<span class="i0">The cataracts of her soul had poured themselves,</span>
<span class="i0">And risen self-crowned in rainbow: would she ask</span>
<span class="i0">Who crowned her?—it sufficed that she was crowned.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With women of my class, ’tis otherwise:</span>
<span class="i0">We haggle for the small change of our gold,</span>
<span class="i0">And so much love, accord, for so much love,</span>
<span class="i0">Rialto-prices. Are we therefore wrong?</span>
<span class="i0">If marriage be a contract, look to it then,</span>
<span class="i0">Contracting parties should be equal, just;</span>
<span class="i0">But if, a simple fealty on one side,</span>
<span class="i0">A mere religion,—right to give, is all,</span>
<span class="i0">And certain brides of Europe duly ask</span>
<span class="i0">To mount the pile, as Indian widows do,</span>
<span class="i0">The spices of their tender youth heaped up,</span>
<span class="i0">The jewels of their gracious virtues worn,</span>
<span class="i0">More gems, more glory,—to consume entire</span>
<span class="i0">For a living husband! as the man’s alive,</span>
<span class="i0">Not dead,—the woman’s duty, by so much,</span>
<span class="i0">Advanced in England, beyond Hindostan.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sate there, musing, till she touched my hand</span>
<span class="i0">With hers, as softly as a strange white bird</span>
<span class="i0">She feared to startle in touching. ‘You are kind.</span>
<span class="i0">But are you, peradventure, vexed at heart</span>
<span class="i0">Because your cousin takes me for a wife?</span>
<span class="i0">I know I am not worthy—nay, in truth,</span>
<span class="i0">I’m glad on’t, since, for that, he chooses me.</span>
<span class="i0">He likes the poor things of the world the best;</span>
<span class="i0">I would not therefore, if I could, be rich.</span>
<span class="i0">It pleasures him to stoop for buttercups;</span>
<span class="i0">I would not be a rose upon the wall</span>
<span class="i0">A queen might stop at, near the palace-door,</span>
<span class="i0">To say to a courtier, ‘Pluck that rose for me,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
<span class="i0">‘It’s prettier than the rest,’ O Romney Leigh!</span>
<span class="i0">I’d rather far be trodden by his foot,</span>
<span class="i0">Than lie in a great queen’s bosom.’</span>
<span class="i29">Out of breath</span>
<span class="i0">She paused.</span>
<span class="i12">‘Sweet Marian, do you disavow</span>
<span class="i0">The roses with that face?’</span>
<span class="i23">She dropt her head,</span>
<span class="i0">As if the wind had caught that flower of her,</span>
<span class="i0">And bent it in the garden,—then looked up</span>
<span class="i0">With grave assurance. ‘Well, you think me bold!</span>
<span class="i0">But so we all are, when we’re praying God.</span>
<span class="i0">And if I’m bold—yet, lady, credit me,</span>
<span class="i0">That, since I know myself for what I am,</span>
<span class="i0">Much fitter for his handmaid than his wife,</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll prove the handmaid and the wife at once,</span>
<span class="i0">Serve tenderly, and love obediently,</span>
<span class="i0">And be a worthier mate, perhaps, than some</span>
<span class="i0">Who are wooed in silk among their learned books;</span>
<span class="i0">While <i>I</i> shall set myself to read his eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Till such grow plainer to me than the French</span>
<span class="i0">To wisest ladies. Do you think I’ll miss</span>
<span class="i0">A letter, in the spelling of his mind?</span>
<span class="i0">No more than they do, when they sit and write</span>
<span class="i0">Their flying words with flickering wild-fowl tails,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever pause to ask how many <i>t</i>s,</span>
<span class="i0">Should that be <i>y</i> or <i>i</i>—they know’t so well:</span>
<span class="i0">I’ve seen them writing, when I brought a dress</span>
<span class="i0">And waited,—floating out their soft white hands</span>
<span class="i0">On shining paper. But they’re hard sometimes,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For all those hands!—we’ve used out many nights,</span>
<span class="i0">And worn the yellow daylight into shreds</span>
<span class="i0">Which flapped and shivered down our aching eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Till night appeared more tolerable, just</span>
<span class="i0">That pretty ladies might look beautiful,</span>
<span class="i0">Who said at last ... ‘You’re lazy in that house!</span>
<span class="i0">‘You’re slow in sending home the work,—I count</span>
<span class="i0">I’ve waited near an hour for’t.’ Pardon me,—</span>
<span class="i0">I do not blame them, madam, nor misprize;</span>
<span class="i0">They are fair and gracious; ay, but not like you,</span>
<span class="i0">Since none but you has Mister Leigh’s own blood</span>
<span class="i0">Both noble and gentle,—and, without it ... well,</span>
<span class="i0">They are fair, I said; so fair, it scarce seems strange</span>
<span class="i0">That, flashing out in any looking-glass</span>
<span class="i0">The wonder of their glorious brows and breasts,</span>
<span class="i0">They are charmed so, they forget to look behind</span>
<span class="i0">And mark how pale we’ve grown, we pitiful</span>
<span class="i0">Remainders of the world. And so, perhaps,</span>
<span class="i0">If Mister Leigh had chosen a wife from these,</span>
<span class="i0">She might ... although he’s better than her best,</span>
<span class="i0">And dearly she would know it ... steal a thought</span>
<span class="i0">Which should be all his, an eye-glance from his face,</span>
<span class="i0">To plunge into the mirror opposite,</span>
<span class="i0">In search of her own beauty’s pearl: while <i>I</i>....</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, dearest lady, serge will outweigh silk</span>
<span class="i0">For winter-wear, when bodies feel a-cold,</span>

<span class="i0">So beautiful, she hurts me like the day</span>
<span class="i0">Let suddenly on sick eyes.</span>
<span class="i22">‘Most kind of all,</span>
<span class="i0">Your cousin!—ah, most like you! Ere you came</span>
<span class="i0">She kissed me mouth to mouth: I felt her soul</span>
<span class="i0">Dip through her serious lips in holy fire.</span>
<span class="i0">God help me, but it made me arrogant;</span>
<span class="i0">I almost told her that you would not lose</span>
<span class="i0">By taking me to wife: though, ever since,</span>
<span class="i0">I’ve pondered much a certain thing she asked ...</span>
<span class="i0">‘He loves you, Marian?’ ... in a sort of mild</span>
<span class="i0">Derisive sadness ... as a mother asks</span>
<span class="i0">Her babe, ‘You’ll touch that star, you think?’</span>
<span class="i19">‘Farewell!</span>
<span class="i0">I know I never touched it.</span>
<span class="i22">This is worst:</span>
<span class="i0">Babes grow, and lose the hope of things above;</span>
<span class="i0">A silver threepence sets them leaping high—</span>
<span class="i0">But no more stars! mark that.</span>
<span class="i25">I’ve writ all night,</span>
<span class="i0">And told you nothing. God, if I could die,</span>
<span class="i0">And let this letter break off innocent</span>
<span class="i0">Just here! But no—for your sake ...</span>
<span class="i32">Here’s the last:</span>
<span class="i0">I never could be happy as your wife,</span>
<span class="i0">I never could be harmless as your friend,</span>
<span class="i0">I never will look more into your face,</span>
<span class="i0">Till God says, ‘Look!’ I charge you, seek me not,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor vex yourself with lamentable thoughts</span>

<span class="i0">Be sure I’m well, I’m merry, I’m at ease,</span>
<span class="i0">But such a long way, long way, long way off,</span>
<span class="i0">I think you’ll find me sooner in my grave,</span>
<span class="i0">And that’s my choice, observe. For what remains,</span>
<span class="i0">An over-generous friend will care for me,</span>
<span class="i0">And keep me happy ... happier....</span>
<span class="i29">There’s a blot!</span>
<span class="i0">This ink runs thick ... we light girls lightly weep ...</span>
<span class="i0">And keep me happier ... was the thing to say, ...</span>
<span class="i0">Than as your wife I could be!—O, my star,</span>
<span class="i0">My saint, my soul! for surely you’re my soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Through whom God touched me! I am not so lost</span>
<span class="i0">I cannot thank you for the good you did,</span>
<span class="i0">The tears you stopped, which fell down bitterly,</span>
<span class="i0">Like these—the times you made me weep for joy</span>
<span class="i0">At hoping I should learn to write your notes</span>
<span class="i0">And save the tiring of your eyes, at night;</span>
<span class="i0">And most for that sweet thrice you kissed my lips</span>
<span class="i0">And said ‘Dear Marian.’</span>
<span class="i20">’Twould be hard to read,</span>
<span class="i0">This letter, for a reader half as learn’d,</span>
<span class="i0">But you’ll be sure to master it, in spite</span>
<span class="i0">Of ups and downs. My hand shakes, I am blind,</span>
<span class="i0">I’m poor at writing, at the best,—and yet</span>
<span class="i0">I tried to make my <i>g</i>s the way you showed.</span>

<span class="i0">We mused on with conjectural fantasy,</span>
<span class="i0">As if some riddle of a summer-cloud</span>
<span class="i0">On which one tries unlike similitudes</span>
<span class="i0">Of now a spotted Hydra-skin cast off,</span>
<span class="i0">And now a screen of carven ivory</span>
<span class="i0">That shuts the heavens’ conventual secrets up</span>
<span class="i0">From mortals over-bold. We sought the sense:</span>
<span class="i0">She loved him so perhaps, (such words mean love,)</span>
<span class="i0">That, worked on by some shrewd perfidious tongue,</span>
<span class="i0">(And then I thought of Lady Waldemar)</span>
<span class="i0">She left him, not to hurt him; or perhaps</span>
<span class="i0">She loved one in her class,—or did not love,</span>
<span class="i0">But mused upon her wild bad tramping life,</span>
<span class="i0">Until the free blood fluttered at her heart,</span>
<span class="i0">And black bread eaten by the road-side hedge</span>
<span class="i0">Seemed sweeter than being put to Romney’s school</span>
<span class="i0">Of philanthropical self-sacrifice,</span>
<span class="i0">Irrevocably.—Girls are girls, beside,</span>
<span class="i0">Thought I, and like a wedding by one rule.</span>
<span class="i0">You seldom catch these birds, except with chaff:</span>
<span class="i0">They feel it almost an immoral thing</span>
<span class="i0">To go out and be married in broad day,</span>
<span class="i0">Unless some winning special flattery should</span>
<span class="i0">Excuse them to themselves for’t, ... ‘No one parts</span>

<span class="i0">One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown!’</span>
<span class="i0">Or else ... ‘You bite your lip in such a way,</span>
<span class="i0">It spoils me for the smiling of the rest’—</span>
<span class="i0">And so on. Then a worthless gaud or two,</span>
<span class="i0">To keep for love,—a ribbon for the neck,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Romney sought her many days and weeks:</span>
<span class="i0">He sifted all the refuse of the town,</span>
<span class="i0">Explored the trains, enquired among the ships,</span>
<span class="i0">And felt the country through from end to end;</span>
<span class="i0">No Marian!—Though I hinted what I knew,—</span>
<span class="i0">A friend of his had reasons of her own</span>
<span class="i0">For throwing back the match—he would not hear:</span>
<span class="i0">The lady had been ailing ever since,</span>
<span class="i0">The shock had harmed her. Something in his tone</span>
<span class="i0">Repressed me; something in me shamed my doubt</span>
<span class="i0">To a sigh, repressed too. He went on to say</span>
<span class="i0">That, putting questions where his Marian lodged,</span>
<span class="i0">He found she had received for visitors,</span>
<span class="i0">Besides himself and Lady Waldemar</span>
<span class="i0">And, that once, me—a dubious woman dressed</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond us both. The rings upon her hands</span>
<span class="i0">Had dazed the children when she threw them pence;</span>
<span class="i0">‘She wore her bonnet as the queen might hers,</span>

<span class="i0">Of roses that had never been in bud.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Romney told me that,—for now and then</span>
<span class="i0">He came to tell me how the search advanced,</span>
<span class="i0">His voice dropped: I bent forward for the rest:</span>
<span class="i0">The woman had been with her, it appeared,</span>
<span class="i0">At first from week to week, then day by day,</span>
<span class="i0">And last, ’twas sure ...</span>
<span class="i19">I looked upon the ground</span>

<span class="i0">To escape the anguish of his eyes, and asked</span>
<span class="i0">As low as when you speak to mourners new</span>
<span class="i0">Of those they cannot bear yet to call dead,</span>
<span class="i0">‘If Marian had as much as named to him</span>
<span class="i0">A certain Rose, an early friend of hers,</span>
<span class="i0">A ruined creature.’</span>
<span class="i15">‘Never,’—Starting up</span>
<span class="i0">He strode from side to side about the room,</span>
<span class="i0">Most like some prisoned lion sprung awake,</span>
<span class="i0">Who has felt the desert sting him through his dreams.</span>
<span class="i0">‘What was I to her, that she should tell me aught?</span>
<span class="i0">A friend! was <i>I</i> a friend? I see all clear.</span>

<span class="i28">I broke through.</span>
<span class="i0">‘Some natures catch no plagues. I’ve read of babes</span>
<span class="i0">Pound whole and sleeping by the spotted breast</span>
<span class="i0">Of one a full day dead. I hold it true,</span>

<span class="i0">That Marian Erle, however lured from place,</span>

<span class="i0">‘The figure’s happy. Well—a dozen carts</span>

<span class="i0">Then softly, as the last repenting drops</span>
<span class="i0">Of a thunder-shower, he added, ‘The poor child;</span>

<span class="i0">But soft!—a ‘poet’ is a word soon said;</span>
<span class="i0">A book’s a thing soon written. Nay, indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">The more the poet shall be questionable,</span>
<span class="i0">The more unquestionably comes his book!</span>
<span class="i0">And this of mine—well, granting to myself</span>
<span class="i0">Some passion in it, furrowing up the flats,</span>
<span class="i0">Mere passion will not prove a volume worth</span>
<span class="i0">Its gall and rags even. Bubbles round a keel</span>
<span class="i0">Mean nought, excepting that the vessel moves.</span>
<span class="i0">There’s more than passion goes to make a man,</span>

<span class="i25">I am sad.</span>
<span class="i0">I wonder if Pygmalion had these doubts,</span>
<span class="i0">And, feeling the hard marble first relent,</span>
<span class="i0">Grow supple to the straining of his arms,</span>
<span class="i0">And tingle through its cold to his burning lip,</span>
<span class="i0">Supposed his senses mocked, and that the toil</span>
<span class="i0">Of stretching past the known and seen, to reach</span>
<span class="i0">The archetypal Beauty out of sight,</span>
<span class="i0">Had made his heart beat fast enough for two,</span>
<span class="i0">And with his own life dazed and blinded him!</span>
<span class="i0">Not so; Pygmalion loved,—and whoso loves</span>
<span class="i0">Believes the impossible.</span>
<span class="i21">And I am sad:</span>
<span class="i0">I cannot thoroughly love a work of mine,</span>
<span class="i0">Since none seems worthy of my thought and hope</span>
<span class="i0">More highly mated. He has shot them down,</span>
<span class="i0">My Phœbus Apollo, soul within my soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Who judges, by the attempted, what’s attained,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I laboured on alone. The wind and dust</span>
<span class="i0">And sun of the world beat blistering in my face;</span>
<span class="i0">And hope, now for me, now against me, dragged</span>
<span class="i0">My spirits onward,—as some fallen balloon,</span>
<span class="i0">Which, whether caught by blossoming tree or bare,</span>
<span class="i0">Is torn alike. I sometimes touched my aim,</span>
<span class="i0">Or seemed,—and generous souls cried out, ‘Be strong,</span>
<span class="i0">Take courage; now you’re on our level,—now!</span>
<span class="i0">The next step saves you!’ I was flushed with praise,</span>

<span class="i0">Affianced lovers, leaning face to face</span>
<span class="i0">With sweet half-listenings for each other’s breath,</span>
<span class="i0">Are reading haply from some page of ours,</span>

<span class="i0">A father, issuing from the misty roads</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the luminous round of lamp and hearth</span>

<span class="i0">Appraised by love, associated with love,</span>
<span class="i0">While <i>we</i> sit loveless! is it hard, you think?</span>
<span class="i0">At least ’tis mournful. Fame, indeed, ’twas said,</span>
<span class="i0">Means simply love. It was a man said that.</span>
<span class="i0">And then, there’s love and love: the love of all</span>

<span class="i14">Hungry! but it’s pitiful</span>

<span class="i0">I never envied Graham his breadth of style,</span>

<span class="i0">Such delicate perspectives of full life;</span>
<span class="i0">Nor Belmore, for the unity of aim</span>

<span class="i0">As sketchers do their pencils; nor Mark Gage,</span>
<span class="i0">For that caressing colour and trancing tone</span>

<span class="i0">The sensual element, which, with a back wave,</span>
<span class="i0">Restores you to the level of pure souls</span>
<span class="i0">And leaves you with Plotinus. None of these,</span>
<span class="i0">For native gifts or popular applause,</span>
<span class="i0">I’ve envied; but for this,—that when, by chance,</span>
<span class="i0">Says some one,—‘There goes Belmore, a great man!</span>
<span class="i0">He leaves clean work behind him, and requires</span>
<span class="i0">No sweeper up of the chips,’ ... a girl I know,</span>
<span class="i0">Who answers nothing, save with her brown eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Smiles unaware, as if a guardian saint</span>
<span class="i0">Smiled in her:—for this, too,—that Gage comes home</span>
<span class="i0">And lays his last book’s prodigal review</span>
<span class="i0">Upon his mother’s knees, where, years ago,</span>
<span class="i0">He had laid his childish spelling-book and learned</span>
<span class="i0">To chirp and peck the letters from her mouth,</span>
<span class="i0">As young birds must. ‘Well done,’ she murmured then,</span>
<span class="i0">She will not say it now more wonderingly;</span>

<span class="i0">As catching up to-day and yesterday</span>
<span class="i0">In a perfect chord of love; and so, Mark Gage.</span>
<span class="i0">I envy you your mother!—and you, Graham,</span>

<span class="i0">Knows how to vex. Sweet heaven, she takes me up</span>
<span class="i0">As if she had fingered me and dog-eared me</span>
<span class="i0">And spelled me by the fireside, half a life!</span>
<span class="i0">She knows my turns, my feeble points.—What then?</span>
<span class="i0">The knowledge of a thing implies the thing;</span>
<span class="i0">Of course, she found <i>that</i> in me, she saw <i>that</i>,</span>
<span class="i0">Her pencil underscored <i>this</i> for a fault,</span>
<span class="i0">And I, still ignorant. Shut the book up! close!</span>
<span class="i0">And crush that beetle in the leaves.</span>
<span class="i32">O heart,</span>
<span class="i0">At last we shall grow hard too, like the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">And call it self-defence because we are soft.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And after all, now, ... why should I be pained,</span>
<span class="i0">That Romney Leigh, my cousin, should espouse</span>
<span class="i0">This Lady Waldemar? And, say, she held</span>
<span class="i0">Her newly-blossomed gladness in my face, ...</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas natural surely, if not generous,</span>
<span class="i0">Considering how, when winter held her fast,</span>
<span class="i0">I helped the frost with mine, and pained her more</span>
<span class="i0">Than she pains me. Pains me!—but wherefore pained?</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis clear my cousin Romney wants a wife,—</span>
<span class="i0">So, good!—The man’s need of the woman, here,</span>
<span class="i0">Is greater than the woman’s of the man,</span>
<span class="i0">And easier served; for where the man discerns</span>
<span class="i0">A sex, (ah, ah, the man can generalise,</span>
<span class="i0">Said he) we see but one, ideally</span>
<span class="i0">And really: where we yearn to lose ourselves</span>
<span class="i0">And melt like white pearls in another’s wine,</span>
<span class="i0">He seeks to double himself by what he loves,</span>
<span class="i0">And make his drink more costly by our pearls.</span>
<span class="i0">At board, at bed, at work, and holiday,</span>
<span class="i0">It is not good for man to be alone,—</span>
<span class="i0">And that’s his way of thinking, first and last;</span>
<span class="i0">And thus my cousin Romney wants a wife.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But then my cousin sets his dignity</span>
<span class="i0">On personal virtue. If he understands</span>
<span class="i0">By love, like others, self-aggrandisement,</span>
<span class="i0">It is that he may verily be great</span>
<span class="i0">By doing rightly and kindly. Once he thought,</span>
<span class="i0">For charitable ends set duly forth</span>
<span class="i0">In Heaven’s white judgment-book, to marry ... ah,</span>
<span class="i0">We’ll call her name Aurora Leigh, although</span>
<span class="i0">She’s changed since then!—and once, for social ends,</span>
<span class="i0">Poor Marian Erle, my sister Marian Erle,</span>
<span class="i0">My woodland sister, sweet maid Marian,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose memory moans on in me like the wind</span>
<span class="i0">Through ill-shut casements, making me more sad</span>
<span class="i0">Than ever I find reasons for. Alas,</span>
<span class="i0">Poor pretty plaintive face, embodied ghost,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He finds it easy, then, to clap thee off</span>
<span class="i0">From pulling at his sleeve and book and pen,—</span>
<span class="i0">He locks thee out at night into the cold,</span>
<span class="i0">Away from butting with thy horny eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Against his crystal dreams,—that, now, he’s strong</span>
<span class="i0">To love anew? that Lady Waldemar</span>
<span class="i0">Succeeds my Marian?</span>
<span class="i20">After all, why not?</span>
<span class="i0">He loved not Marian, more than once he loved</span>
<span class="i0">Aurora. If he loves, at last, that Third,</span>
<span class="i0">Albeit she prove as slippery as spilt oil</span>
<span class="i0">On marble floors, I will not augur him</span>
<span class="i0">Ill luck for that. Good love, howe’er ill-placed,</span>
<span class="i0">Is better for a man’s soul in the end,</span>
<span class="i0">Than if he loved ill what deserves love well.</span>
<span class="i0">A pagan, kissing, for a step of Pan,</span>
<span class="i0">The wild-goat’s hoof-print on the loamy down,</span>
<span class="i0">Exceeds our modern thinker who turns back</span>
<span class="i0">The strata ... granite, limestone, coal, and clay,</span>
<span class="i0">Concluding coldly with, ‘Here’s law! Where’s God?’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then at worse,—if Romney loves her not,—</span>
<span class="i0">At worst,—if he’s incapable of love,</span>
<span class="i0">Which may be—then indeed, for such a man</span>
<span class="i0">Incapable of love, she’s good enough;</span>
<span class="i0">For she, at worst too, is a woman still</span>
<span class="i0">And loves him ... as the sort of woman can.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My loose long hair began to burn and creep,</span>
<span class="i0">Alive to the very ends, about my knees:</span>

<span class="i0">I swept it backward as the wind sweeps flame,</span>

<span class="i0">One day ... (how full the memories come up!)</span>
<span class="i0">‘—Your Florence fire-flies live on in your hair,’</span>
<span class="i0">He said, ‘it gleams so.’ Well, I wrung them out,</span>
<span class="i0">My fire-flies; made a knot as hard as life,</span>
<span class="i0">Of those loose, soft, impracticable curls,</span>
<span class="i0">And then sat down and thought.... ‘She shall not think</span>
<span class="i0">Her thought of me,’—and drew my desk and wrote.</span>

<span class="i22">And then we’ll have</span>
<span class="i0">The call to church; the broken, sad, bad dream</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The</span> English have a scornful insular way</span>
<span class="i0">Of calling the French light. The levity</span>
<span class="i0">Is in the judgment only, which yet stands;</span>
<span class="i0">For say a foolish thing but oft enough,</span>
<span class="i0">(And here’s the secret of a hundred creeds,—</span>
<span class="i0">Men get opinions as boys learn to spell,</span>
<span class="i0">By re-iteration chiefly) the same thing</span>
<span class="i0">Shall pass at last for absolutely wise,</span>
<span class="i0">And not with fools exclusively. And so,</span>
<span class="i0">We say the French are light, as if we said</span>
<span class="i0">The cat mews, or the milch-cow gives us milk:</span>
<span class="i0">Say rather, cats are milked, and milch-cows mew;</span>
<span class="i0">For what is lightness but inconsequence,</span>
<span class="i0">Vague fluctuation ’twixt effect and cause,</span>
<span class="i0">Compelled by neither? Is a bullet light,</span>
<span class="i0">That dashes from the gun-mouth, while the eye</span>
<span class="i0">Winks, and the heart beats one, to flatten itself</span>
<span class="i0">To a wafer on the white speck on a wall</span>
<span class="i0">A hundred paces off? Even so direct,</span>
<span class="i0">So sternly undivertible of aim,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Is this French people.</span>
<span class="i20">All, idealists</span>
<span class="i0">Too absolute and earnest, with them all</span>
<span class="i0">The idea of a knife cuts real flesh;</span>
<span class="i0">And still, devouring the safe interval</span>
<span class="i0">Which Nature placed between the thought and act,</span>
<span class="i0">With those too fiery and impatient souls,</span>
<span class="i0">They threaten conflagration to the world</span>
<span class="i0">And rush with most unscrupulous logic on</span>
<span class="i0">Impossible practice. Set your orators</span>
<span class="i0">To blow upon them with loud windy mouths</span>
<span class="i0">Through watchword phrases, jest or sentiment,</span>
<span class="i0">Which drive our burley brutal English mobs</span>
<span class="i0">Like so much chaff, whichever way they blow,—</span>
<span class="i0">This light French people will not thus be driven.</span>
<span class="i0">They turn indeed; but then they turn upon</span>
<span class="i0">Some central pivot of their thought and choice,</span>
<span class="i0">And veer out by the force of holding fast.</span>
<span class="i0">—That’s hard to understand, for Englishmen</span>
<span class="i0">Unused to abstract questions, and untrained</span>
<span class="i0">To trace the involutions, valve by valve,</span>
<span class="i0">In each orbed bulb-root of a general truth,</span>
<span class="i0">And mark what subtly fine integument</span>
<span class="i0">Divides opposed compartments. Freedom’s self</span>
<span class="i0">Comes concrete to us, to be understood,</span>
<span class="i0">Fixed in a feudal form incarnately</span>
<span class="i0">To suit our ways of thought and reverence,</span>
<span class="i0">The special form, with us, being still the thing.</span>
<span class="i0">With us, I say, though I’m of Italy</span>

<span class="i0">And memory; let it be,—a poet’s heart</span>

<span class="i0">However ill-lodged in a woman’s breast.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so I am strong to love this noble France,</span>
<span class="i0">This poet of the nations, who dreams on</span>
<span class="i0">And wails on (while the household goes to wreck)</span>
<span class="i0">For ever, after some ideal good,—</span>
<span class="i0">Some equal poise of sex, some unvowed love</span>
<span class="i0">Inviolate, some spontaneous brotherhood,</span>
<span class="i0">Some wealth, that leaves none poor and finds none tired,</span>
<span class="i0">Some freedom of the many, that respects</span>
<span class="i0">The wisdom of the few. Heroic dreams!</span>
<span class="i0">Sublime, to dream so; natural, to wake:</span>
<span class="i0">And sad, to use such lofty scaffoldings,</span>
<span class="i0">Erected for the building of a church,</span>
<span class="i0">To build instead, a brothel ... or a prison—</span>
<span class="i0">May God save France!</span>
<span class="i18">However she have sighed</span>
<span class="i0">Her great soul up into a great man’s face,</span>
<span class="i0">To flush his temples out so gloriously</span>
<span class="i0">That few dare carp at Cæsar for being bald,</span>
<span class="i0">What then?—this Cæsar represents, not reigns,</span>
<span class="i0">And is no despot, though twice absolute;</span>
<span class="i0">This Head has all the people for a heart;</span>
<span class="i0">This purple’s lined with the democracy,—</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A serious riddle: find such anywhere</span>

<span class="i0">Except in France; and when it’s found in France,</span>
<span class="i0">Be sure to read it rightly. So, I mused</span>
<span class="i0">Up and down, up and down, the terraced streets,</span>
<span class="i0">The glittering boulevards, the white colonnades</span>
<span class="i0">Of fair fantastic Paris who wears boughs</span>
<span class="i0">Like plumes, as if man made them,—tossing up</span>
<span class="i0">Her fountains in the sunshine from the squares,</span>
<span class="i0">As dice i’ the game of beauty, sure to win;</span>
<span class="i0">Or as she blew the down-balls of her dreams,</span>
<span class="i0">And only waited for their falling back,</span>
<span class="i0">To breathe up more, and count her festive hours.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The city swims in verdure, beautiful</span>
<span class="i0">As Venice on the waters, the sea-swan.</span>
<span class="i0">What bosky gardens, dropped in close-walled courts,</span>
<span class="i0">As plums in ladies’ laps, who start and laugh:</span>
<span class="i0">What miles of streets that run on after trees,</span>
<span class="i0">Still carrying the necessary shops,</span>
<span class="i0">Those open caskets, with the jewels seen!</span>
<span class="i0">And trade is art, and art’s philosophy,</span>
<span class="i0">In Paris. There’s a silk, for instance, there,</span>
<span class="i0">As worth an artist’s study for the folds,</span>
<span class="i0">As that bronze opposite! nay, the bronze has faults;</span>
<span class="i0">Art’s here too artful,—conscious as a maid,</span>
<span class="i0">Who leans to mark her shadow on the wall</span>
<span class="i0">Until she lose a ’vantage in her step.</span>
<span class="i0">Yet Art walks forward, and knows where to walk:</span>
<span class="i0">The artists also, are idealists,</span>
<span class="i0">Too absolute for nature, logical</span>
<span class="i0">To austerity in the application of</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The special theory: not a soul content</span>
<span class="i0">To paint a crooked pollard and an ass,</span>
<span class="i0">As the English will, because they find it so,</span>

<span class="i0">Sweet Marian’ ... (weeping in a tender rage)</span>
<span class="i0">‘Sweet holy Marian! And now, Marian, now,</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll use your oath although my lips are hard,</span>
<span class="i0">And by the child, my Marian, by the child,</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll swear his mother shall be innocent</span>
<span class="i0">Before my conscience, as in the open Book</span>
<span class="i0">Of Him who reads for judgement. Innocent,</span>
<span class="i0">My sister! let the night be ne’er so dark,</span>
<span class="i0">The moon is surely somewhere in the sky;</span>
<span class="i0">So surely is your whiteness to be found</span>
<span class="i0">Through all dark facts. But pardon, pardon me,</span>
<span class="i0">And smile a little, Marian,—for the child,</span>
<span class="i0">If not for me, my sister.’</span>
<span class="i22">The poor lip</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Just motioned for the smile and let it go:</span>
<span class="i0">And then, with scarce a stirring of the mouth,</span>
<span class="i0">As if a statue spoke that could not breathe,</span>
<span class="i0">But spoke on calm between its marble lips,—</span>
<span class="i0">‘I’m glad, I’m very glad you clear me so.</span>
<span class="i0">I should be sorry that you set me down</span>
<span class="i0">With harlots, or with even a better name</span>
<span class="i0">Which misbecomes his mother. For the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">I am not on a level with your love,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever was, you know,—but now am worse,</span>
<span class="i0">Because that world of yours has dealt with me</span>
<span class="i0">As when the hard sea bites and chews a stone</span>
<span class="i0">And changes the first form of it. I’ve marked</span>
<span class="i0">A shore of pebbles bitten to one shape</span>
<span class="i0">From all the various life of madrepores;</span>
<span class="i0">And so, that little stone, called Marian Erle,</span>
<span class="i0">Picked up and dropped by you and another friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Was ground and tortured by the incessant sea</span>
<span class="i0">And bruised from what she was,—changed! death’s a change,</span>
<span class="i0">And she, I said, was murdered; Marian’s dead.</span>
<span class="i0">What can you do with people when they are dead,</span>
<span class="i0">But, if you are pious, sing a hymn and go,</span>
<span class="i0">Or, if you are tender, heave a sigh and go,</span>
<span class="i0">But go by all means,—and permit the grass</span>
<span class="i0">To keep its green feud up ’twixt them and you?</span>
<span class="i0">Then leave me,—let me rest. I’m dead, I say.</span>
<span class="i0">And if, to save the child from death as well,</span>
<span class="i0">The mother in me has survived the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">Why, that’s God’s miracle you must not tax,—</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I’m not less dead for that: I’m nothing more</span>
<span class="i0">But just a mother. Only for the child,</span>
<span class="i0">I’m warm, and cold, and hungry, and afraid,</span>
<span class="i0">And smell the flowers a little, and see the sun,</span>
<span class="i0">And speak still, and am silent,—just for him!</span>
<span class="i0">I pray you therefore to mistake me not,</span>
<span class="i0">And treat me, haply, as I were alive;</span>
<span class="i0">For though you ran a pin into my soul,</span>
<span class="i0">I think it would not hurt nor trouble me.</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s proof, dear lady,—in the market-place</span>
<span class="i0">But now, you promised me to say a word</span>
<span class="i0">About ... a friend, who once, long years ago,</span>
<span class="i0">Took God’s place toward me, when He draws and loves</span>
<span class="i0">And does not thunder, ... whom at last I left,</span>
<span class="i0">As all of us leave God. You thought perhaps,</span>
<span class="i0">I seemed to care for hearing of that friend?</span>
<span class="i0">Now, judge me! we have sate here half-an-hour</span>
<span class="i0">And talked together of the child and me,</span>
<span class="i0">And I not asked as much as, ‘What’s the thing</span>
<span class="i0">You had to tell me of the friend ... the friend?’</span>
<span class="i0">He’s sad, I think you said,—he’s sick perhaps?</span>
<span class="i0">It’s nought to Marian if he’s sad or sick.</span>
<span class="i0">Another would have crawled beside your foot</span>
<span class="i0">And prayed your words out. Why, a beast, a dog,</span>
<span class="i0">A starved cat, if he had fed it once with milk,</span>
<span class="i0">Would show less hardness. But I’m dead, you see,</span>
<span class="i0">And that explains it.’</span>
<span class="i18">Poor, poor thing, she spoke</span>
<span class="i0">And shook her head, as white and calm as frost</span>
<span class="i0">On days too cold for raining any more,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But still with such a face, so much alive,</span>
<span class="i0">I could not choose but take it on my arm</span>
<span class="i0">And stroke the placid patience of its cheeks,—</span>
<span class="i0">Then told my story out, of Romney Leigh,</span>
<span class="i0">How, having lost her, sought her, missed her still,</span>
<span class="i0">He, broken-hearted for himself and her,</span>
<span class="i0">Had drawn the curtains of the world awhile</span>
<span class="i0">As if he had done with morning. There I stopped,</span>
<span class="i0">For when she gasped, and pressed me with her eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">‘And now ... how is it with him? tell me now,’—</span>
<span class="i0">I felt the shame of compensated grief,</span>
<span class="i0">And chose my words with scruple—slowly stepped</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the slippery stones set here and there</span>
<span class="i0">Across the sliding water. ‘Certainly,</span>
<span class="i0">As evening empties morning into night,</span>
<span class="i0">Another morning takes the evening up</span>
<span class="i0">With healthful, providential interchange;</span>
<span class="i0">And, though he thought still of her,’—</span>
<span class="i34">‘Yes, she knew,</span>
<span class="i0">She understood: she had supposed, indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">That, as one stops a hole upon a flute,</span>
<span class="i0">At which a new note comes and shapes the tune,</span>
<span class="i0">Excluding her would bring a worthier in,</span>
<span class="i0">And, long ere this, that Lady Waldemar</span>
<span class="i0">He loved so’ ...</span>
<span class="i12">‘Loved,’ I started,—‘loved her so!</span>
<span class="i0">Now tell me’ ...</span>
<span class="i12">‘I will tell you,’ she replied:</span>
<span class="i0">‘But since we’re taking oaths, you’ll promise first</span>

<span class="i0">The honourable ribbon of his name,</span>
<span class="i0">Fell unaware, and came to butchery:</span>
<span class="i0">Because,—I know him,—as he takes to heart</span>
<span class="i0">The grief of every stranger, he’s not like</span>

<span class="i0">In wishing him most happy. Now he leaves</span>

<span class="i0">Unkind, and left him,—but if once he knew ...</span>
<span class="i0">Ah, then, the sharp nail of my cruel wrong</span>
<span class="i0">Would fasten me for ever in his sight,</span>
<span class="i0">Like some poor curious bird, through each spread wing</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I answered gaily, though my whole voice wept;</span>

<span class="i0">Unmoved by shame or anger,—so she spoke.</span>
<span class="i0">She told me she had loved upon her knees,</span>
<span class="i0">As others pray, more perfectly absorbed</span>
<span class="i0">In the act and aspiration. She felt his,</span>

<span class="i0">For just his uses, not her own at all,</span>
<span class="i0">His stool, to sit on, or put up his foot,</span>
<span class="i0">His cup, to fill with wine or vinegar,</span>
<span class="i0">Whichever drink might please him at the chance,</span>
<span class="i0">For that should please her always: let him write</span>
<span class="i0">His name upon her ... it seemed natural;</span>
<span class="i0">It was most precious, standing on his shelf,</span>
<span class="i0">To wait until he chose to lift his hand.</span>
<span class="i0">Well, well,—I saw her then, and must have seen</span>
<span class="i0">How bright her life went, floating on her love,</span>
<span class="i0">Like wicks the housewives send afloat on oil,</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To do good seemed so much his business,</span>

<span class="i0">‘What could you hope,’ she said, ‘of such as she?</span>

<span class="i0">To spend their goodness on her, which she took</span>
<span class="i0">So very gladly, as a part of his,—</span>
<span class="i0">By slow degrees, it broke on her slow sense,</span>
<span class="i0">That she, too, in that Eden of delight</span>
<span class="i0">Was out of place, and, like the silly kid,</span>
<span class="i0">Still did most mischief where she meant most love.</span>
<span class="i0">A thought enough to make a woman mad,</span>

<span class="i0">Or leave it in the foldings of her gown,</span>

<span class="i0">One thing alone was certain,—from the day</span>
<span class="i0">The gracious lady paid a visit first,</span>

<span class="i0">The flats I had never climbed from, could perceive</span>
<span class="i0">If such as I, might grow upon the hills;</span>
<span class="i0">And whether such poor herb sufficed to grow,</span>
<span class="i0">For Romney Leigh to break his fast upon ’t,—</span>
<span class="i0">Or would he pine on such, or haply starve?’</span>
<span class="i0">She wrapt me in her generous arms at once,</span>
<span class="i0">And let me dream a moment how it feels</span>
<span class="i0">To have a real mother, like some girls:</span>
<span class="i0">But when I looked, her face was younger ... ay,</span>
<span class="i0">Youth’s too bright not to be a little hard,</span>
<span class="i0">And beauty keeps itself still uppermost,</span>
<span class="i0">That’s true!—Though Lady Waldemar was kind,</span>
<span class="i0">She hurt me, hurt, as if the morning-sun</span>
<span class="i0">Should smite us on the eyelids when we sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">And wake us up with headache. Ay, and soon</span>
<span class="i0">Was light enough to make my heart ache too:</span>

<span class="i0">‘That Romney could not love me, if he would,</span>
<span class="i0">As men call loving; there are bloods that flow</span>
<span class="i0">Together, like some rivers, and not mix,</span>
<span class="i0">Through contraries of nature. He indeed</span>

<span class="i0">At which I stopped her,—‘This for me. And now</span>
<span class="i0">‘For <i>him</i>.’—She murmured,—truth grew difficult;</span>
<span class="i0">She owned, ‘’Twas plain a man like Romney Leigh</span>
<span class="i0">Required a wife more level to himself.</span>
<span class="i0">If day by day he had to bend his height</span>
<span class="i0">To pick up sympathies, opinions, thoughts,</span>

<span class="i0">As two strong arms will always raise a child</span>

<span class="i0">‘That could not be,’ she feared. ‘You take a pink,</span>
<span class="i0">You dig about its roots and water it,</span>
<span class="i0">And so improve it to a garden-pink,</span>
<span class="i0">But will not change it to a heliotrope,</span>
<span class="i0">The kind remains. And then, the harder truth—</span>

<span class="i0">I thought,—Perhaps he’s sliding now the ring</span>

<span class="i24">She went on:</span>

<span class="i0">The blossomed offshoot from my thorny life,—</span>

<span class="i0">For which I thanked the Lady Waldemar,</span>

<span class="i0">This lying smoothly in a bed to die.</span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">I never liked the woman’s face, or voice,</span>

<span class="i0">As if one hated me, who had power to hurt;</span>

<span class="i0">At last I spoke to Lady Waldemar:</span>

<span class="i0">By some prodigious Dream-fear at my back</span>

<span class="i0">And there I sate, one evening, by the road,</span>

<span class="i0">Through all the heaving of impatient life</span>
<span class="i0">Which threw me on death at intervals,—through all</span>
<span class="i0">The upbreak of the fountains of my heart</span>
<span class="i0">The rains had swelled too large: it could mean <i>that</i>?</span>

<span class="i0">To heaven, not her, until it tore my throat.</span>
<span class="i0">‘Confess, confess!’ what was there to confess,</span>
<span class="i0">Except man’s cruelty, except my wrong?</span>
<span class="i0">Except this anguish, or this ecstasy?</span>
<span class="i0">This shame, or glory? The light woman there</span>

<span class="i0">Would take the sea in sooner.</span>

<span class="i26">‘All the rest</span>
<span class="i0">Is here,’ she said, and signed upon the child.</span>
<span class="i0">‘I found a mistress-sempstress who was kind</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She looked me in the face and answered not,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor signed she was unworthy, nor gave thanks,</span>

<span class="i0">To meet my kiss, as if requiting me</span>

<span class="i0">To pay your debts is scarcely difficult;</span>
<span class="i0">To buy your life is nearly impossible,</span>

<span class="i0">A man might walk a little ... but I!—He loves</span>
<span class="i0">The Lamia-woman,—and I, write to him</span>
<span class="i0">What stops his marriage, and destroys his peace,—</span>
<span class="i0">Or what, perhaps, shall simply trouble him,</span>
<span class="i0">Until she only need to touch his sleeve</span>
<span class="i0">With just a finger’s tremulous white flame,</span>
<span class="i0">Saying, ‘Ah,—Aurora Leigh! a pretty tale,</span>

<span class="i0">A very pretty poet! I can guess</span>
<span class="i0">The motive’—then, to catch his eyes in hers,</span>
<span class="i0">And vow she does not wonder,—and they two</span>
<span class="i0">To break in laughter, as the sea along</span>
<span class="i0">A melancholy coast, and float up higher,</span>
<span class="i0">In such a laugh, their fatal weeds of love!</span>

<span class="i0">To a voice not hers, nor yet that enemy’s,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor God’s in wrath, ... but one that mixed with mine</span>
<span class="i0">Long years ago, among the garden-trees,</span>
<span class="i0">And said to <i>me</i>, to <i>me</i> too, ‘Be my wife,</span>

<span class="i0">Of yearning passion, as snow of ghosts</span>
<span class="i0">Might beat against the impervious doors of heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">I thought, ‘Now, if I had been a woman, such</span>

<span class="i0">By just my love I might have saved this man,</span>

<span class="i0">And, by my only fault, his empty house</span>
<span class="i0">Sucks in, at this same hour, a wind from hell</span>
<span class="i0">To keep his hearth cold, make his casements creak</span>
<span class="i0">For ever to the tune of plague and sin—</span>
<span class="i0">O Romney, O my Romney, O my friend!</span>
<span class="i0">My cousin and friend! my helper, when I would,</span>

<span class="i0">At strongest, women are as weak in flesh,</span>
<span class="i0">As men, at weakest, vilest, are in soul:</span>
<span class="i0">So, hard for women to keep pace with men!</span>
<span class="i0">As well give up at once, sit down at once,</span>
<span class="i0">And weep as I do. Tears, tears! <i>why</i>, we weep?</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis worth enquiry?—That we’ve shamed a life,</span>
<span class="i0">Or lost a love, or missed a world, perhaps?</span>
<span class="i0">By no means. Simply, that we’ve walked too far,</span>
<span class="i0">Or talked too much, or felt the wind i’ the east,—</span>
<span class="i0">And so we weep, as if both body and soul</span>
<span class="i0">Broke up in water—this way.</span>
<span class="i24">Poor mixed rags</span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth we’re made of, like those other dolls</span>
<span class="i0">That lean with pretty faces into fairs.</span>

<span class="i22">Yet indeed,</span>

<span class="i0">To undo it, though we should undo ourselves;</span>
<span class="i0">Ay, all the more, that we undo ourselves;</span>
<span class="i0">That’s womanly, past doubt, and not ill-moved.</span>
<span class="i0">A natural movement, therefore, on my part,</span>
<span class="i0">To fill the chair up of my cousin’s wife,</span>
<span class="i0">And save him from a devil’s company!</span>
<span class="i0">We’re all so,—made so—’tis our woman’s trade</span>

<span class="i0">Which now he counts so vile, that all the towns</span>
<span class="i0">Make offal of their daughters for its use</span>
<span class="i0">On summer-nights, when God is sad in heaven</span>
<span class="i0">To think what goes on in his recreant world</span>
<span class="i0">He made quite other; while that moon He made</span>
<span class="i0">To shine there, at the first love’s covenant,</span>

<span class="i0">Before adulterous eyes.</span>
<span class="i18">How sure it is,</span>
<span class="i0">That, if we say a true word, instantly</span>
<span class="i0">We feel ’tis God’s, not ours, and pass it on</span>
<span class="i0">As bread at sacrament, we taste and pass</span>

<span class="i0">We dared to set up any claim to such!</span>
<span class="i0">And I—my poem;—let my readers talk;</span>
<span class="i0">I’m closer to it—I can speak as well:</span>
<span class="i0">I’ll say, with Romney, that the book is weak,</span>
<span class="i0">The range uneven, the points of sight obscure,</span>
<span class="i0">The music interrupted.</span>
<span class="i18">Let us go.</span>
<span class="i0">The end of woman (or of man, I think)</span>
<span class="i0">Is not a book. Alas, the best of books</span>
<span class="i0">Is but a word in Art, which soon grows cramped,</span>
<span class="i0">Stiff, dubious-statured with the weight of years,</span>
<span class="i0">And drops an accent or digamma down</span>
<span class="i0">Some cranny of unfathomable time,</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the critic’s reaching. Art itself,</span>
<span class="i0">We’ve called the higher life, still must feel the soul</span>
<span class="i0">Live past it. For more’s felt than is perceived,</span>
<span class="i0">And more’s perceived than can be interpreted,</span>
<span class="i0">And Love strikes higher with his lambent flame</span>
<span class="i0">Than Art can pile the faggots.</span>
<span class="i26">Is it so?</span>
<span class="i0">When Jove’s hand meets us with composing touch,</span>
<span class="i0">And when, at last, we are hushed and satisfied,—</span>
<span class="i0">Then, Io does not call it truth, but love?</span>

<span class="i0">This Florence sits upon me easily,</span>

<span class="i0">To suck the stream for ages and get green,</span>

<span class="i0">Had warmed the place with ichor. Such I’ve found</span>
<span class="i0">At early morning, laid across my bed,</span>

<span class="i0">Which even Marian’s low precipitous ‘hush’</span>
<span class="i0">Had vainly interposed to put away,—</span>
<span class="i0">While I, with shut eyes, smile and motion for</span>
<span class="i0">The dewy kiss that’s very sure to come</span>
<span class="i0">From mouth and cheeks, the whole child’s face at once</span>
<span class="i0">Dissolved on mine,—as if a nosegay burst</span>
<span class="i0">Its string with the weight of roses overblown,</span>
<span class="i0">And dropt upon me. Surely I should be glad.</span>
<span class="i0">The little creature almost loves me now,</span>

<span class="i0">And mournfully I lived. I knew the birds</span>

<span class="i0">The moths, with that great overpoise of wings</span>

<span class="i0">Each flight they take: and fire-flies, that suspire</span>
<span class="i0">In short soft lapses of transported flame</span>
<span class="i0">Across the tingling Dark, while overhead</span>
<span class="i0">The constant and inviolable stars</span>
<span class="i0">Outburn those lights-of-love: melodious owls,</span>

<span class="i0">To which we are blind: and then, the nightingales,</span>

<span class="i0">(When walking in the town) and carry it</span>
<span class="i0">So high into the bowery almond-trees,</span>
<span class="i0">We tremble and are afraid, and feel as if</span>
<span class="i0">The golden flood of moonlight unaware</span>
<span class="i0">Dissolved the pillars of the steady earth</span>
<span class="i0">And made it less substantial. And I knew</span>
<span class="i0">The harmless opal snakes, and large-mouthed frogs,</span>
<span class="i0">(Those noisy vaunters of their shallow streams)</span>
<span class="i0">And lizards, the green lightnings of the wall,</span>

<span class="i0">Will flatter you and take you for a stone,</span>
<span class="i0">And flash familiarly about your feet</span>
<span class="i0">With such prodigious eyes in such small heads!—</span>
<span class="i0">I knew them, though they had somewhat dwindled from</span>

<span class="i0">Before the Adam in him has foregone</span>
<span class="i0">All privilege of Eden,—making friends</span>
<span class="i0">And talk, with such a bird or such a goat,</span>
<span class="i0">And buying many a two-inch-wide rush-cage</span>
<span class="i0">To let out the caged cricket on a tree,</span>
<span class="i0">Saying, ‘Oh, my dear grillino, were you cramped?</span>
<span class="i0">And are you happy with the ilex-leaves?</span>

<span class="i0">Or why you look so pale still, since it’s gone?</span>
<span class="i0">—Such most surprising riddance of one’s life</span>
<span class="i0">Comes next one’s death; it’s disembodiment</span>
<span class="i0">Without the pang. I marvel, people choose</span>
<span class="i0">To stand stock-still like fakirs, till the moss</span>
<span class="i0">Grows on them, and they cry out, self-admired,</span>
<span class="i0">‘How verdant and how virtuous!’ Well, I’m glad:</span>
<span class="i0">Or should be, if grown foreign to myself</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As surely as to others.</span>
<span class="i20">Musing so,</span>
<span class="i0">I walked the narrow unrecognising streets,</span>
<span class="i0">Where many a palace-front peers gloomily</span>
<span class="i0">Through stony vizors iron-barred, (prepared</span>
<span class="i0">Alike, should foe or lover pass that way,</span>
<span class="i0">For guest or victim) and came wandering out</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the churches with mild open doors</span>
<span class="i0">And plaintive wail of vespers, where a few,</span>
<span class="i0">Those chiefly women, sprinkled round in blots</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the dusky pavement, knelt and prayed</span>
<span class="i0">Toward the altar’s silver glory. Oft a ray</span>
<span class="i0">(I liked to sit and watch) would tremble out,</span>
<span class="i0">Just touch some face more lifted, more in need,</span>
<span class="i0">Of course a woman’s—while I dreamed a tale</span>
<span class="i0">To fit its fortunes. There was one who looked</span>
<span class="i0">As if the earth had suddenly grown too large</span>
<span class="i0">For such a little humpbacked thing as she;</span>
<span class="i0">The pitiful black kerchief round her neck</span>
<span class="i0">Sole proof she had had a mother. One, again,</span>
<span class="i0">Looked sick for love,—seemed praying some soft saint</span>
<span class="i0">To put more virtue in the new fine scarf</span>
<span class="i0">She spent a fortnight’s meals on, yesterday,</span>
<span class="i0">That cruel Gigi might return his eyes</span>
<span class="i0">From Giuliana. There was one, so old,</span>
<span class="i0">So old, to kneel grew easier than to stand,—</span>
<span class="i0">So solitary, she accepts at last</span>
<span class="i0">Our Lady for her gossip, and frets on</span>
<span class="i0">Against the sinful world which goes its rounds</span>
<span class="i0">In marrying and being married, just the same</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As when ’twas almost good and had the right,</span>
<span class="i0">(Her Gian alive, and she herself eighteen).</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, now even, if Madonna willed,</span>
<span class="i0">She’d win a tern in Thursday’s lottery,</span>
<span class="i0">And better all things. Did she dream for nought,</span>
<span class="i0">That, boiling cabbage for the fast-day’s soup,</span>
<span class="i0">It smelt like blessed entrails? such a dream</span>
<span class="i0">For nought? would sweetest Mary cheat her so,</span>
<span class="i0">And lose that certain candle, straight and white</span>
<span class="i0">As any fair grand-duchess in her teens,</span>

<span class="i0"><i>Benigna sis</i>, thou beauteous Queen of heaven!</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sate there musing, and imagining</span>
<span class="i0">Such utterance from such faces: poor blind souls</span>
<span class="i0">That writhed toward heaven along the devil’s trail,—</span>
<span class="i0">Who knows, I thought, but He may stretch his hand</span>
<span class="i0">And pick them up? ’tis written in the Book,</span>
<span class="i0">He heareth the young ravens when they cry;</span>
<span class="i0">And yet they cry for carrion.—O my God,—</span>
<span class="i0">And we, who make excuses for the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">We do it in our measure. Then I knelt,</span>
<span class="i0">And dropped my head upon the pavement too,</span>
<span class="i0">And prayed, since I was foolish in desire</span>
<span class="i0">Like other creatures, craving offal-food,</span>
<span class="i0">That He would stop his ears to what I said,</span>
<span class="i0">And only listen to the run and beat</span>
<span class="i0">Of this poor, passionate, helpless blood—</span>

<span class="i0">I could not lose a sunset on the bridge,</span>
<span class="i0">And would not miss a vigil in the church,</span>
<span class="i0">And liked to mingle with the out-door crowd</span>
<span class="i0">So strange and gay and ignorant of my face,</span>
<span class="i0">For men you know not, are as good as trees.</span>
<span class="i0">And only once, at the Santissima,</span>
<span class="i0">I almost chanced upon a man I knew,</span>
<span class="i0">Sir Blaise Delorme. He saw me certainly,</span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat hurried, as he crossed himself,</span>
<span class="i0">The smoothness of the action,—then half bowed,</span>
<span class="i0">But only half, and merely to my shade,</span>
<span class="i0">I slipped so quick behind the porphyry plinth,</span>
<span class="i0">And left him dubious if ’twas really I,</span>
<span class="i0">Or peradventure Satan’s usual trick</span>
<span class="i0">To keep a mounting saint uncanonised.</span>
<span class="i0">But I was safe for that time, and he too;</span>
<span class="i0">The argent angels in the altar-flare</span>
<span class="i0">Absorbed his soul, next moment. The good man!</span>
<span class="i0">In England we were scarce acquaintances,</span>
<span class="i0">That here in Florence he should keep my thought</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the image on his eye, which came</span>
<span class="i0">And went: and yet his thought disturbed my life:</span>
<span class="i0">For, after that, I oftener sate at home</span>
<span class="i0">On evenings, watching how they fined themselves</span>
<span class="i0">With gradual conscience to a perfect night,</span>
<span class="i0">Until the moon, diminished to a curve,</span>
<span class="i0">Lay out there, like a sickle for His hand</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I feared to jingle bells upon my robe</span>
<span class="i0">Before the four-faced silent cherubim:</span>
<span class="i0">With God so near me, could I sing of God?</span>
<span class="i0">I did not write, nor read, nor even think,</span>
<span class="i0">But sate absorbed amid the quickening glooms,</span>
<span class="i0">Most like some passive broken lump of salt</span>
<span class="i0">Dropt in by chance to a bowl of œnomel,</span>
<span class="i0">To spoil the drink a little, and lose itself,</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">One</span> eve it happened, when I sate alone,</span>
<span class="i0">Alone, upon the terrace of my tower,</span>
<span class="i0">A book upon my knees, to counterfeit</span>
<span class="i0">The reading that I never read at all,</span>
<span class="i0">While Marian, in the garden down below,</span>
<span class="i0">Knelt by the fountain (I could just hear thrill</span>
<span class="i0">The drowsy silence of the exhausted day)</span>
<span class="i0">And peeled a new fig from that purple heap</span>
<span class="i0">In the grass beside her,—turning out the red</span>
<span class="i0">To feed her eager child, who sucked at it</span>
<span class="i0">With vehement lips across a gap of air</span>
<span class="i0">As he stood opposite, face and curls a-flame</span>
<span class="i0">With that last sun-ray, crying, ‘give me, give,’</span>
<span class="i0">And stamping with imperious baby-feet,</span>
<span class="i0">(We’re all born princes)—something startled me,—</span>
<span class="i0">The laugh of sad and innocent souls, that breaks</span>
<span class="i0">Abruptly, as if frightened at itself;</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas Marian laughed. I saw her glance above</span>
<span class="i0">In sudden shame that I should hear her laugh,</span>
<span class="i0">And straightway dropped my eyes upon my book,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And knew, the first time, ’twas Boccaccio’s tales,</span>
<span class="i0">The Falcon’s,—of the lover who for love</span>
<span class="i0">Destroyed the best that loved him. Some of us</span>
<span class="i0">Do it still, and then we sit and laugh no more.</span>
<span class="i0">Laugh <i>you</i>, sweet Marian! you’ve the right to laugh,</span>
<span class="i0">Since God himself is for you, and a child!</span>
<span class="i0">For me there’s somewhat less,—and so, I sigh.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The heavens were making room to hold the night,</span>
<span class="i0">The sevenfold heavens unfolding all their gates</span>
<span class="i0">To let the stars out slowly (prophesied</span>
<span class="i0">In close-approaching advent, not discerned),</span>
<span class="i0">While still the cue-owls from the cypresses</span>
<span class="i0">Of the Poggio called and counted every pulse</span>
<span class="i0">Of the skyey palpitation. Gradually</span>
<span class="i0">The purple and transparent shadows slow</span>
<span class="i0">Had filled up the whole valley to the brim,</span>
<span class="i0">And flooded all the city, which you saw</span>
<span class="i0">As some drowned city in some enchanted sea,</span>
<span class="i0">Cut off from nature,—drawing you who gaze,</span>
<span class="i0">With passionate desire, to leap and plunge,</span>
<span class="i0">And find a sea-king with a voice of waves,</span>
<span class="i0">And treacherous soft eyes, and slippery locks</span>
<span class="i0">You cannot kiss but you shall bring away</span>
<span class="i0">Their salt upon your lips. The duomo-bell</span>
<span class="i0">Strikes ten, as if it struck ten fathoms down,</span>
<span class="i0">So deep; and fifty churches answer it</span>
<span class="i0">The same, with fifty various instances.</span>

<span class="i0">To guard that fair church, Buonarroti’s Bride,</span>
<span class="i0">That stares out from her large blind dial-eyes,</span>
<span class="i0">Her quadrant and armillary dials, black</span>
<span class="i0">With rhythms of many suns and moons, in vain</span>
<span class="i0">Enquiry for so rich a soul as his,—</span>

<span class="i0">He answered in a voice which was not his.</span>
<span class="i0">‘I have her letter; you shall read it soon:</span>

<span class="i0">Although you thought to have shut a tedious book</span>
<span class="i0">And farewell. Ah, you dog-eared such a page,</span>

<span class="i18">Did he touch my hand,</span>
<span class="i0">Or but my sleeve? I trembled, hand and foot,—</span>
<span class="i0">He must have touched me.—‘Will you sit?’ I asked,</span>
<span class="i0">And motioned to a chair; but down he sate,</span>
<span class="i0">A little slowly, as a man in doubt,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the couch beside me,—couch and chair</span>
<span class="i0">Being wheeled upon the terrace.</span>
<span class="i26">‘You are come,</span>
<span class="i0">My cousin Romney?—this is wonderful.</span>
<span class="i0">But all is wonder on such summer-nights;</span>

<span class="i0">He murmured.</span>
<span class="i14">‘Yes, I know,’ I said, ‘I know.</span>
<span class="i0">I had the news from Vincent Carrington.</span>

<span class="i16">‘Do <i>you</i> take it so?’</span>

<span class="i34">Nay, I thought,</span>

<span class="i0">Whate’er our state, we must have made it first;</span>
<span class="i0">And though the thing displease us, ay, perhaps</span>
<span class="i0">Displease us warrantably, never doubt</span>
<span class="i0">That other states, thought possible once, and then</span>
<span class="i0">Rejected by the instinct of our lives,—</span>
<span class="i0">If then adopted, had displeased us more</span>
<span class="i0">Than this, in which the choice, the will, the love,</span>
<span class="i0">Has stamped the honour of a patent act</span>
<span class="i0">From henceforth. What we choose, may not be good;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But, that we choose it, proves it good for <i>us</i></span>
<span class="i0">Potentially, fantastically, now</span>
<span class="i0">Or last year, rather than a thing we saw,</span>
<span class="i0">And saw no need for choosing. Moths will burn</span>
<span class="i0">Their wings,—which proves that light is good for moths,</span>
<span class="i0">Or else they had flown not, where they agonise,’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Ay, light is good,’ he echoed, and there paused.</span>
<span class="i0">And then abruptly, ... ‘Marian. Marian’s well?’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I bowed my head, but found no word. ’Twas hard</span>
<span class="i0">To speak of <i>her</i> to Lady Waldemar’s</span>
<span class="i0">New husband. How much did he know, at last?</span>
<span class="i0">How much? how little?—— He would take no sign,</span>
<span class="i0">But straight repeated,—‘Marian. Is she well?’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘She’s well,’ I answered.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">She was there in sight</span>
<span class="i0">An hour back, but the night had drawn her home;</span>
<span class="i0">Where still I heard her in an upper room,</span>
<span class="i0">Her low voice singing to the child in bed,</span>
<span class="i0">Who restless with the summer-heat and play</span>
<span class="i0">And slumber snatched at noon, was long sometimes</span>
<span class="i0">At falling off, and took a score of songs</span>
<span class="i0">And mother-hushes, ere she saw him sound.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘She’s well,’ I answered.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i32">‘Yes, here.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He stopped and sighed. ‘That shall be presently,</span>
<span class="i0">But now this must be. I have words to say,</span>
<span class="i0">And would be alone to say them, I with you,</span>
<span class="i0">And no third troubling.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">‘Speak then,’ I returned,</span>
<span class="i0">‘She will not vex you.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">At which, suddenly</span>
<span class="i0">He turned his face upon me with its smile,</span>
<span class="i0">As if to crush me. ‘I have read your book,</span>
<span class="i0">Aurora.’</span>
<span class="i10">‘You have read it,’ I replied,</span>
<span class="i0">‘And I have writ it,—we have done with it.</span>
<span class="i0">And now the rest?’</span>
<span class="i18">‘The rest is like the first,’</span>
<span class="i0">He answered,—‘for the book is in my heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Lives in me, wakes in me, and dreams in me:</span>
<span class="i0">My daily bread tastes of it,—and my wine</span>
<span class="i0">Which has no smack of it, I pour it out;</span>
<span class="i0">It seems unnatural drinking.’</span>
<span class="i24">Bitterly</span>
<span class="i0">I took the word up; ‘Never waste your wine.</span>
<span class="i0">The book lived in me ere it lived in you;</span>
<span class="i0">I know it closer than another does,</span>
<span class="i0">And that it’s foolish, feeble, and afraid,</span>

<span class="i0">Still wish some happier fortune to your friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Than even to have written a far better book.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He answered gently, ‘That is consequent:</span>
<span class="i0">The poet looks beyond the book he has made,</span>
<span class="i0">Or else he had not made it. If a man</span>
<span class="i0">Could make a man, he’d henceforth be a god</span>
<span class="i0">In feeling what a little thing is man:</span>
<span class="i0">It is not my case. And this special book,</span>
<span class="i0">I did not make it, to make light of it:</span>
<span class="i0">It stands above my knowledge, draws me up;</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis high to me. It may be that the book</span>
<span class="i0">Is not so high, but I so low, instead;</span>
<span class="i0">Still high to me. I mean no compliment:</span>
<span class="i0">I will not say there are not, young or old,</span>
<span class="i0">Male writers, ay, or female,—let it pass,</span>

<span class="i0">Enough that she alone has looked at him</span>
<span class="i0">With eyes that, large or small, have won his soul.</span>
<span class="i0">And so, this book, Aurora,—so, your book.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Alas,’ I answered, ‘is it so, indeed?’</span>
<span class="i0">And then was silent.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">I said,—‘I’m thinking of a far-off June,</span>

<span class="i0">The same Aurora of the bright June day</span>
<span class="i0">That withered up the flowers before my face,</span>

<span class="i18">‘Can I understand?’</span>
<span class="i0">I broke in. ‘You speak wildly, Romney Leigh,</span>

<span class="i0">I’m very happy that you like my book,</span>

<span class="i0">A ten years’ birthday; ’twas so mad a thing</span>

<span class="i20">‘Speak wisely, cousin Leigh.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Yes, wisely, dear Aurora, though too late:</span>
<span class="i0">But then, not wisely. I was heavy then,</span>

<span class="i0">Too close: I could not hear the angels lift</span>
<span class="i0">A fold of rustling air, nor what they said</span>
<span class="i0">To help my pity. I beheld the world</span>

<span class="i0">Professing equally,—‘an open mouth</span>
<span class="i0">A gross want, food to fill us, and no more!’</span>
<span class="i0">Why that’s so far from virtue, only vice</span>

<span class="i0">Once, twice, and oftener,—hearing through the rents</span>
<span class="i0">Of obstinate purpose, still those words of yours,</span>
<span class="i0">‘<i>You will not compass your poor ends, not you!</i>’</span>
<span class="i0">But harder than you said them; every time</span>

<span class="i15">‘You wholly misconceive,’</span>

<span class="i14">I returned,—‘I’m glad of it;</span>

<span class="i0">The soul’s the way. Not even Christ Himself</span>
<span class="i0">Can save man else than as He holds man’s soul;</span>

<span class="i0">We both were wrong that June-day,—both as wrong</span>
<span class="i0">As an east wind had been. I who talked of art,</span>
<span class="i0">And you who grieved for all men’s griefs ... what then?</span>
<span class="i0">We surely made too small a part for God</span>
<span class="i0">In these things. What we are, imports us more</span>
<span class="i0">Than what we eat; and life, you’ve granted me,</span>
<span class="i0">Develops from within. But innermost</span>
<span class="i0">Of the inmost, most interior of the interne,</span>
<span class="i0">God claims his own, Divine humanity</span>

<span class="i0">As much upon the outside of a man,</span>
<span class="i0">As the very bowl, in which he dips his beard.</span>
<span class="i0">—And then, ... the rest. I cannot surely speak.</span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps I doubt more than you doubted then,</span>
<span class="i0">If I, the poet’s veritable charge,</span>
<span class="i0">Have borne upon my forehead. If I have,</span>
<span class="i0">It might feel somewhat liker to a crown,</span>
<span class="i0">The foolish green one even.—Ah, I think,</span>
<span class="i0">And chiefly when the sun shines, that I’ve failed.</span>
<span class="i0">But what then, Romney? Though we fail indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">You ... I ... a score of such weak workers, ... He</span>
<span class="i0">Fails never. If He cannot work by us,</span>
<span class="i0">He will work over us. Does He want a man,</span>
<span class="i0">Much less a woman, think you? Every time</span>
<span class="i0">The star winks there, so many souls are born,</span>
<span class="i0">Who all shall work too. Let our own be calm:</span>
<span class="i0">We should be ashamed to sit beneath those stars,</span>
<span class="i0">Impatient that we’re nothing.’</span>

<span class="i0">And yet, indeed, your book has dealt with me</span>
<span class="i0">More gently, cousin, than you ever will!</span>
<span class="i0">The book brought down entire the bright June-day,</span>
<span class="i0">And set me wandering in the garden-walks,</span>
<span class="i0">And let me watch the garland in a place,</span>
<span class="i0">You blushed so ... nay, forgive me; do not stir:</span>
<span class="i0">I only thank the book for what it taught,</span>
<span class="i0">And what, permitted. Poet, doubt yourself;</span>
<span class="i0">But never doubt that you’re a poet to me</span>
<span class="i0">From henceforth. Ah, you’ve written poems, sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">Which moved me in secret, as the sap is moved</span>
<span class="i0">In still March-branches, signless as a stone:</span>
<span class="i0">But this last book o’ercame me like soft rain</span>
<span class="i0">Which falls at midnight, when the tightened bark</span>
<span class="i0">Breaks out into unhesitating buds,</span>
<span class="i0">And sudden protestations of the spring.</span>
<span class="i0">In all your other books, I saw but <i>you</i>:</span>
<span class="i0">A man may see the moon so, in a pond,</span>
<span class="i0">And not be nearer therefore to the moon,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor use the sight ... except to drown himself:</span>
<span class="i0">And so I forced my heart back from the sight;</span>
<span class="i0">For what had <i>I</i>, I thought, to do with <i>her</i>,—</span>
<span class="i0">Aurora ... Romney? But, in this last book,</span>
<span class="i0">You showed me something separate from yourself,</span>
<span class="i0">Beyond you; and I bore to take it in,</span>
<span class="i0">And let it draw me. You have shown me truths,</span>
<span class="i0">O June-day friend, that help me now at night,</span>

<span class="i0">Presented by your voice and verse the way</span>
<span class="i0">To take them clearest. Verily I was wrong;</span>
<span class="i0">And verily, many thinkers of this age,</span>
<span class="i0">Ay, many Christian teachers, half in heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">Are wrong in just my sense, who understood</span>
<span class="i0">Our natural world too insularly, as if</span>

<span class="i0">(Though reason and nature beat us in the face);</span>
<span class="i0">So obstinately, that we’ll break our teeth</span>
<span class="i0">Or ever we let go. For everywhere</span>
<span class="i0">We’re too materialistic,—eating clay,</span>

<span class="i0">And Noah’s wine; clay by handfuls, clay by lumps,</span>
<span class="i0">Until we’re filled up to the throat with clay,</span>
<span class="i0">And grow the grimy colour of the ground</span>
<span class="i0">On which we are feeding. Ay, materialist</span>
<span class="i0">The age’s name is. God himself, with some,</span>
<span class="i0">Is apprehended as the bare result</span>
<span class="i0">Of what his hand materially has made,</span>
<span class="i0">Expressed in such an algebraic sign,</span>
<span class="i0">Called God;—that is, to put it otherwise,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They add up nature to a naught of God</span>
<span class="i0">And cross the quotient. There are many, even,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose names are written in the Christian church</span>
<span class="i0">To no dishonour,—diet still on mud,</span>
<span class="i0">And splash the altars with it. You might think</span>
<span class="i0">The clay, Christ laid upon their eyelids when,</span>
<span class="i0">Still blind, he called them to the use of sight,</span>
<span class="i0">Remained there to retard its exercise</span>
<span class="i0">With clogging incrustations. Close to heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">They see, for mysteries, through the open doors,</span>
<span class="i0">Vague puffs of smoke from pots of earthenware;</span>

<span class="i0">I do not think that any common she</span>
<span class="i0">Would dare adopt such fancy-forgeries</span>
<span class="i0">For the legible life-signature of such</span>
<span class="i0">As I, with all my blots: with all my blots!</span>
<span class="i0">At last then, peerless cousin, we are peers—</span>
<span class="i0">At last we’re even. Ah, you’ve left your height;</span>
<span class="i0">And here upon my level we take hands,</span>
<span class="i0">And here I reach you to forgive you, sweet,</span>
<span class="i0">And that’s a fall, Aurora. Long ago</span>
<span class="i0">You seldom understood me,—but, before,</span>
<span class="i0">I could not blame you. Then, you only seemed</span>
<span class="i0">So high above, you could not see below;</span>
<span class="i0">But now I breathe,—but now I pardon!—nay,</span>
<span class="i0">We’re parting. Dearest, men have burnt my house,</span>
<span class="i0">Maligned my motives,—but not one, I swear,</span>
<span class="i0">Has wronged my soul as this Aurora has,</span>
<span class="i0">Who called the Lady Waldemar my wife.’</span>

<span class="i0">Nay, read the lines’ (he held a letter out)</span>
<span class="i0">‘She sent you through me.’</span>
<span class="i22">By the moonlight there,</span>
<span class="i0">I tore the meaning out with passionate haste</span>
<span class="i0">Much rather than I read it. Thus it ran.</span>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Even</span> thus. I pause to write it out at length,</span>
<span class="i0">The letter of the Lady Waldemar.—</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘I prayed your cousin Leigh to take you this,</span>
<span class="i0">He says he’ll do it. After years of love,</span>
<span class="i0">Or what is called so,—when a woman frets</span>
<span class="i0">And fools upon one string of a man’s name,</span>
<span class="i0">And fingers it for ever till it breaks,—</span>
<span class="i0">He may perhaps do for her such a thing,</span>
<span class="i0">And she accept it without detriment</span>
<span class="i0">Although she should not love him any more.</span>
<span class="i0">And I, who do not love him, nor love you,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor you, Aurora,—choose you shall repent</span>
<span class="i0">Your most ungracious letter, and confess,</span>
<span class="i0">Constrained by his convictions, (he’s convinced)</span>
<span class="i0">You’ve wronged me foully. Are you made so ill,</span>
<span class="i0">You woman—to impute such ill to <i>me</i>?</span>
<span class="i0">We both had mothers,—lay in their bosom once.</span>
<span class="i0">Why, after all, I thank you, Aurora Leigh,</span>
<span class="i0">For proving to myself that there are things</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I would not do, ... not for my life ... nor him ...</span>
<span class="i0">Though something I have somewhat overdone,—</span>
<span class="i0">For instance, when I went to see the gods</span>
<span class="i0">One morning on Olympus, with a step</span>
<span class="i0">That shook the thunder in a certain cloud,</span>
<span class="i0">Committing myself vilely. Could I think,</span>
<span class="i0">The Muse I pulled my heart out from my breast</span>
<span class="i0">To soften, had herself a sort of heart,</span>
<span class="i0">And loved my mortal? He, at least, loved her;</span>
<span class="i0">I heard him say so; ’twas my recompence,</span>
<span class="i0">When, watching at his bedside fourteen days,</span>
<span class="i0">He broke out ever like a flame at whiles</span>
<span class="i0">Between the heats of fever.... ‘Is it thou?</span>
<span class="i0">Breathe closer, sweetest mouth!’ and when at last</span>
<span class="i0">The fever gone, the wasted face extinct</span>
<span class="i0">As if it irked him much to know me there,</span>
<span class="i0">He said, ‘’Twas kind, ’twas good, ’twas womanly,’</span>
<span class="i0">(And fifty praises to excuse one love)</span>
<span class="i0">‘But was the picture safe he had ventured for?’</span>
<span class="i0">And then, half wandering ... ‘I have loved her well,</span>
<span class="i0">Although she could not love me.’—‘Say instead,’</span>
<span class="i0">I answered, ‘that she loves you.’—’Twas my turn</span>
<span class="i0">To rave: (I would have married him so changed,</span>
<span class="i0">Although the world had jeered me properly</span>
<span class="i0">For taking up with Cupid at his worst,</span>
<span class="i0">The silver quiver worn off on his hair.)</span>
<span class="i0">‘No, no,’ he murmured, ‘no, she loves me not;</span>
<span class="i0">Aurora Leigh does better: bring her book</span>
<span class="i0">And read it softly, Lady Waldemar,</span>
<span class="i0">Until I thank your friendship more for that,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Than even for harder service.’ So I read</span>
<span class="i0">Your book, Aurora, for an hour, that day:</span>
<span class="i0">I kept its pauses, marked its emphasis;</span>
<span class="i0">My voice, empaled upon rhyme’s golden hooks,</span>
<span class="i0">Not once would writhe, nor quiver, nor revolt;</span>
<span class="i0">I read on calmly,—calmly shut it up,</span>
<span class="i0">Observing, ‘There’s some merit in the book.</span>
<span class="i0">And yet the merit in’t is thrown away</span>
<span class="i0">As chances still with women, if we write</span>
<span class="i0">Or write not: we want string to tie our flowers,</span>
<span class="i0">So drop them as we walk, which serves to show</span>
<span class="i0">The way we went. Good morning, Mister Leigh;</span>
<span class="i0">You’ll find another reader the next time.</span>
<span class="i0">A woman who does better than to love,</span>
<span class="i0">I hate; she will do nothing very well:</span>
<span class="i0">Male poets are preferable, tiring less</span>
<span class="i0">And teaching more.’ I triumphed o’er you both,</span>
<span class="i0">And left him.</span>
<span class="i14">‘When I saw him afterward,</span>
<span class="i0">I had read your shameful letter, and my heart.</span>
<span class="i0">He came with health recovered, strong though pale,</span>
<span class="i0">Lord Howe and he, a courteous pair of friends,</span>
<span class="i0">To say what men dare say to women, when</span>
<span class="i0">Their debtors. But I stopped them with a word;</span>
<span class="i0">And proved I had never trodden such a road,</span>
<span class="i0">To carry so much dirt upon my shoe.</span>
<span class="i0">Then, putting into it something of disdain,</span>
<span class="i0">I asked forsooth his pardon, and my own,</span>
<span class="i0">For having done no better than to love,</span>
<span class="i0">And that, not wisely,—though ’twas long ago,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And though ’twas altered perfectly since then.</span>
<span class="i0">I told him, as I tell you now, Miss Leigh,</span>
<span class="i0">And proved I took some trouble for his sake</span>
<span class="i0">(Because I knew he did not love the girl)</span>
<span class="i0">To spoil my hands with working in the stream</span>
<span class="i0">Of that poor bubbling nature,—till she went,</span>
<span class="i0">Consigned to one I trusted, my own maid,</span>
<span class="i0">Who once had lived full five months in my house,</span>
<span class="i0">(Dressed hair superbly) with a lavish purse</span>
<span class="i0">To carry to Australia where she had left</span>
<span class="i0">A husband, said she. If the creature lied,</span>
<span class="i0">The mission failed, we all do fail and lie</span>
<span class="i0">More or less—and I’m sorry—which is all</span>
<span class="i0">Expected from us when we fail the most,</span>
<span class="i0">And go to church to own it. What I meant,</span>
<span class="i0">Was just the best for him, and me, and her ...</span>
<span class="i0">Best even for Marian!—I am sorry for’t,</span>
<span class="i0">And very sorry. Yet my creature said</span>
<span class="i0">She saw her stop to speak in Oxford Street</span>
<span class="i0">To one ... no matter! I had sooner cut</span>
<span class="i0">My hand off (though ’twere kissed the hour before,</span>
<span class="i0">And promised a pearl troth-ring for the next)</span>
<span class="i0">Than crush her silly head with so much wrong.</span>
<span class="i0">Poor child! I would have mended it with gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Until it gleamed like St. Sophia’s dome</span>
<span class="i0">When all the faithful troop to morning prayer:</span>
<span class="i0">But he, he nipped the bud of such a thought</span>
<span class="i0">With that cold Leigh look which I fancied once,</span>
<span class="i0">And broke in, ‘Henceforth she was called his wife.</span>
<span class="i0">His wife required no succour: he was bound</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To Florence, to resume this broken bond:</span>
<span class="i0">Enough so. Both were happy, he and Howe,</span>
<span class="i0">To acquit me of the heaviest charge of all—’</span>
<span class="i0">—At which I shot my tongue against my fly</span>
<span class="i0">And struck him; ‘Would he carry,—he was just,—</span>
<span class="i0">A letter from me to Aurora Leigh,</span>
<span class="i0">And ratify from his authentic mouth</span>
<span class="i0">My answer to her accusation?’—‘Yes,</span>
<span class="i0">If such a letter were prepared in time.’</span>
<span class="i0">—He’s just, your cousin,—ay, abhorrently.</span>
<span class="i0">He’d wash his hands in blood, to keep them clean.</span>
<span class="i0">And so, cold, courteous, a mere gentleman,</span>
<span class="i0">He bowed, we parted.</span>
<span class="i22">‘Parted. Face no more,</span>
<span class="i0">Voice no more, love no more! wiped wholly out</span>
<span class="i0">Like some ill scholar’s scrawl from heart and slate,—</span>
<span class="i0">Ay, spit on and so wiped out utterly</span>
<span class="i0">By some coarse scholar! I have been too coarse,</span>
<span class="i0">Too human. Have we business, in our rank,</span>
<span class="i0">With blood i’ the veins? I will have henceforth none;</span>
<span class="i0">Not even to keep the colour at my lip.</span>
<span class="i0">A rose is pink and pretty without blood;</span>
<span class="i0">Why not a woman? When we’ve played in vain</span>
<span class="i0">The game, to adore,—we have resources still,</span>
<span class="i0">And can play on at leisure, being adored:</span>
<span class="i0">Here’s Smith already swearing at my feet</span>
<span class="i0">That I’m the typic She. Away with Smith!—</span>
<span class="i0">Smith smacks of Leigh,—and, henceforth, I’ll admit</span>
<span class="i0">No socialist within three crinolines,</span>
<span class="i0">To live and have his being. But for you,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Though insolent your letter and absurd,</span>
<span class="i0">And though I hate you frankly,—take my Smith!</span>
<span class="i0">For when you have seen this famous marriage tied,</span>
<span class="i0">A most unspotted Erle to a noble Leigh,</span>
<span class="i0">(His love astray on one he should not love)</span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit you should not want his love, beware,</span>
<span class="i0">You’ll want some comfort. So I leave you Smith;</span>
<span class="i0">Take Smith!—he talks Leigh’s subjects, somewhat worse;</span>
<span class="i0">Adopts a thought of Leigh’s, and dwindles it;</span>
<span class="i0">Goes leagues beyond, to be no inch behind;</span>
<span class="i0">Will mind you of him, as a shoe-string may,</span>
<span class="i0">Of a man: and women, when they are made like you,</span>
<span class="i0">Grow tender to a shoe-string, footprint even,</span>
<span class="i0">Adore averted shoulders in a glass,</span>
<span class="i0">And memories of what, present once, was loathed.</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, you loathed not Romney,—though you’ve played</span>
<span class="i0">At ‘fox and goose’ about him with your soul:</span>
<span class="i0">Pass over fox, you rub out fox,—ignore</span>
<span class="i0">A feeling, you eradicate it,—the act’s</span>
<span class="i0">Identical.</span>
<span class="i8">I wish you joy, Miss Leigh.</span>
<span class="i0">You’ve made a happy marriage for your friend;</span>
<span class="i0">And all the honour, well-assorted love,</span>
<span class="i0">Derives from you who love him, whom he loves!</span>
<span class="i0">You need not wish <i>me</i> joy to think of it,</span>
<span class="i0">I have so much. Observe, Aurora Leigh;</span>
<span class="i0">Your droop of eyelid is the same as his,</span>
<span class="i0">And, but for you, I might have won his love,</span>
<span class="i0">And, to you, I have shown my naked heart,—</span>
<span class="i0">For which three things I hate, hate, hate you. Hush,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Suppose a fourth!—I cannot choose but think</span>
<span class="i0">That, with him, I were virtuouser than you</span>
<span class="i0">Without him: so I hate you from this gulf</span>
<span class="i0">And hollow of my soul, which opens out</span>
<span class="i0">To what, except for you, had been my heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">And is instead, a place to curse by! <span class="smcap">Love.</span>’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An active kind of curse. I stood there cursed—</span>
<span class="i0">Confounded. I had seized and caught the sense</span>
<span class="i0">Of the letter with its twenty stinging snakes,</span>
<span class="i0">In a moment’s sweep of eyesight, and I stood</span>
<span class="i0">Dazed.—‘Ah!—not married.’</span>
<span class="i22">‘You mistake,’ he said;</span>
<span class="i0">‘I’m married. Is not Marian Erle my wife?</span>
<span class="i0">As God sees things, I have a wife and child;</span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I felt it hard to breathe, much less to speak.</span>

<span class="i0">‘My great good angel, Romney.’</span>
<span class="i26">Then at first,</span>
<span class="i0">I knew that Marian Erle was beautiful.</span>
<span class="i0">She stood there, still and pallid as a saint,</span>
<span class="i0">Dilated, like a saint in ecstasy,</span>
<span class="i0">As if the floating moonshine interposed</span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt her foot and the earth, and raised her up</span>
<span class="i0">To float upon it. ‘I had left my child,</span>
<span class="i0">Who sleeps,’ she said, ‘and, having drawn this way,</span>

<span class="i0">Must never, never, never join hands so.</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, let me say it,—for I said it first</span>
<span class="i0">To God, and placed it, rounded to an oath,</span>
<span class="i0">Far, far above the moon there, at His feet,</span>
<span class="i0">As surely as I wept just now at yours,—</span>
<span class="i0">We never, never, never join hands so.</span>
<span class="i0">And now, be patient with me; do not think</span>
<span class="i0">I’m speaking from a false humility.</span>
<span class="i0">The truth is, I am grown so proud with grief,</span>
<span class="i0">And He has said so often through his nights</span>
<span class="i0">And through his mornings, ‘Weep a little still,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou foolish Marian, because women must,</span>
<span class="i0">But do not blush at all except for sin,’—</span>
<span class="i0">That I, who felt myself unworthy once</span>
<span class="i0">Of virtuous Romney and his high-born race,</span>
<span class="i0">Have come to learn, ... a woman, poor or rich,</span>
<span class="i0">Despised or honoured, is a human soul;</span>
<span class="i0">And what her soul is,—that, she is herself,</span>
<span class="i0">Although she should be spit upon of men,</span>
<span class="i0">As is the pavement of the churches here,</span>
<span class="i0">Still good enough to pray in. And, being chaste</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And honest, and inclined to do the right,</span>
<span class="i0">And love the truth, and live my life out green</span>
<span class="i0">And smooth beneath his steps, I should not fear</span>
<span class="i0">To make him, thus, a less uneasy time</span>
<span class="i0">Than many a happier woman. Very proud</span>
<span class="i0">You see me. Pardon, that I set a trap</span>
<span class="i0">To hear a confirmation in your voice ...</span>
<span class="i0">Both yours and yours. It is so good to know</span>
<span class="i0">’Twas really God who said the same before:</span>
<span class="i0">For thus it is in heaven, that first God speaks,</span>
<span class="i0">And then his angels. Oh, it does me good,</span>
<span class="i0">It wipes me clean and sweet from devil’s dirt,</span>
<span class="i0">That Romney Leigh should think me worthy still</span>
<span class="i0">Of being his true and honourable wife!</span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth I need not say, on leaving earth,</span>
<span class="i0">I had no glory in it. For the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">The reason’s ready (master, angel, friend,</span>
<span class="i0">Be patient with me) wherefore you and I</span>
<span class="i0">Can never, never, never join hands so.</span>
<span class="i0">I know you’ll not be angry like a man</span>
<span class="i0">(For <i>you</i> are none) when I shall tell the truth,—</span>
<span class="i0">Which is, I do not love you, Romney Leigh,</span>
<span class="i0">I do not love you. Ah well! catch my hands,</span>
<span class="i0">Miss Leigh, and burn into my eyes with yours,—</span>
<span class="i0">I swear I do not love him. Did I once?</span>
<span class="i0">’Tis said that women have been bruised to death,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet, if once they loved, that love of theirs</span>
<span class="i0">Could never be drained out with all their blood:</span>
<span class="i0">I’ve heard such things and pondered. Did I indeed</span>
<span class="i0">Love once? or did I only worship? Yes,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, O friend, I set you up so high</span>
<span class="i0">Above all actual good or hope of good,</span>
<span class="i0">Or fear of evil, all that could be mine,</span>
<span class="i0">I haply set you above love itself,</span>
<span class="i0">And out of reach of these poor woman’s arms,</span>
<span class="i0">Angelic Romney. What was in my thought?</span>
<span class="i0">To be your slave, your help, your toy, your tool.</span>
<span class="i0">To be your love ... I never thought of that.</span>
<span class="i0">To give you love ... still less. I gave you love?</span>
<span class="i0">I think I did not give you anything;</span>
<span class="i0">I was but only yours,—upon my knees,</span>
<span class="i0">All yours, in soul and body, in head and heart,—</span>
<span class="i0">A creature you had taken from the ground,</span>
<span class="i0">Still crumbling through your fingers to your feet</span>
<span class="i0">To join the dust she came from. Did I love,</span>
<span class="i0">Or did I worship? judge, Aurora Leigh!</span>
<span class="i0">But, if indeed I loved, ’twas long ago,—</span>
<span class="i0">So long! before the sun and moon were made,</span>
<span class="i0">Before the hells were open,—ah, before</span>
<span class="i0">I heard my child cry in the desert night,</span>
<span class="i0">And knew he had no father. It may be,</span>
<span class="i0">I’m not as strong as other women are,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, torn and crushed, are not undone from love.</span>
<span class="i0">It may be, I am colder than the dead,</span>
<span class="i0">Who, being dead, love always. But for me</span>
<span class="i0">Once killed, ... this ghost of Marian loves no more,</span>
<span class="i0">No more ... except the child!... no more at all.</span>
<span class="i0">I told your cousin, sir, that I was dead;</span>
<span class="i0">And now, she thinks I’ll get up from my grave,</span>
<span class="i0">And wear my chin-cloth for a wedding-veil,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And glide along the churchyard like a bride,</span>
<span class="i0">While all the dead keep whispering through the withes,</span>
<span class="i0">‘You would be better in your place with us,</span>
<span class="i0">You pitiful corruption!’ At the thought,</span>
<span class="i0">The damps break out on me like leprosy,</span>
<span class="i0">Although I’m clean. Ay, clean as Marian Erle:</span>
<span class="i0">As Marian Leigh, I know, I were not clean:</span>
<span class="i0">I have not so much life that I should love,</span>
<span class="i0">... Except the child. Ah God! I could not bear</span>
<span class="i0">To see my darling on a good man’s knees,</span>
<span class="i0">And know by such a look, or such a sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">Or such a silence, that he thought sometimes,</span>
<span class="i0">‘This child was fathered by some cursed wretch’ ...</span>
<span class="i0">For, Romney,—angels are less tender-wise</span>
<span class="i0">Than God and mothers: even <i>you</i> would think</span>
<span class="i0">What <i>we</i> think never. He is ours, the child;</span>
<span class="i0">And we would sooner vex a soul in heaven</span>
<span class="i0">By coupling with it the dead body’s thought,</span>
<span class="i0">It left behind it in a last month’s grave,</span>
<span class="i0">Than, in my child, see other than ... my child.</span>
<span class="i0">We only, never call him fatherless</span>
<span class="i0">Who has God and his mother. O my babe,</span>
<span class="i0">My pretty, pretty blossom, an ill-wind</span>

<span class="i0">I’d have another,—one called happier,</span>
<span class="i0">A fathered child, with father’s love and race</span>
<span class="i0">That’s worn as bold and open as a smile,</span>
<span class="i0">To vex my darling when he’s asked his name</span>
<span class="i0">And has no answer? What! a happier child</span>

<span class="i0">My kisses are all melted on one mouth;</span>
<span class="i0">I would not push my darling to a stool</span>

<span class="i0">In all our life. A handful of the earth</span>
<span class="i0">To make God’s image! the despised poor earth,</span>
<span class="i0">The healthy odorous earth,—I missed, with it,</span>
<span class="i0">The divine Breath that blows the nostrils out</span>
<span class="i0">To ineffable inflatus: ay, the breath</span>
<span class="i0">Which love is. Art is much, but love is more.</span>
<span class="i0">O Art, my Art, thou’rt much, but Love is more!</span>
<span class="i0">Art symbolises heaven, but Love is God</span>
<span class="i0">And makes heaven. I, Aurora, fell from mine:</span>
<span class="i0">I would not be a woman like the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">A simple woman who believes in love,</span>
<span class="i0">And owns the right of love because she loves,</span>
<span class="i0">And, hearing she’s beloved, is satisfied</span>
<span class="i0">With what contents God: I must analyse,</span>
<span class="i0">Confront, and question; just as if a fly</span>
<span class="i0">Refused to warm itself in any sun</span>
<span class="i0">Till such was <i>in leone</i>: I must fret</span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth, because the month was only May;</span>
<span class="i0">Be faithless of the kind of proffered love,</span>
<span class="i0">And captious, lest it miss my dignity,</span>
<span class="i0">And scornful, that my lover sought a wife</span>
<span class="i0">To use ... to use! O Romney, O my love,</span>
<span class="i0">I am changed since then, changed wholly,—for indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">If now you’d stoop so low to take my love,</span>
<span class="i0">And use it roughly, without stint or spare,</span>
<span class="i0">As men use common things with more behind,</span>
<span class="i0">(And, in this, ever would be more behind)</span>
<span class="i0">To any mean and ordinary end,—</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The joy would set me like a star, in heaven,</span>
<span class="i0">So high up, I should shine because of height</span>
<span class="i0">And not of virtue. Yet in one respect,</span>
<span class="i0">Just one, beloved, I am in no wise changed:</span>
<span class="i0">I love you, loved you ... loved you first and last,</span>
<span class="i0">And love you on for ever. Now I know</span>
<span class="i0">I loved you always, Romney. She who died</span>
<span class="i0">Knew that, and said so; Lady Waldemar</span>
<span class="i0">Knows that; ... and Marian: I had known the same</span>
<span class="i0">Except that I was prouder than I knew,</span>
<span class="i0">And not so honest. Ay, and, as I live,</span>
<span class="i0">I should have died so, crushing in my hand</span>
<span class="i0">This rose of love, the wasp inside and all,—</span>
<span class="i0">Ignoring ever to my soul and you</span>
<span class="i0">Both rose and pain,—except for this great loss,</span>
<span class="i0">This great despair,—to stand before your face</span>
<span class="i0">And know I cannot win a look of yours.</span>
<span class="i0">You think, perhaps, I am not changed from pride,</span>
<span class="i0">And that I chiefly bear to say such words,</span>
<span class="i0">Because you cannot shame me with your eyes?</span>
<span class="i0">O calm, grand eyes, extinguished in a storm,</span>
<span class="i0">Blown out like lights o’er melancholy seas,</span>
<span class="i0">Though shrieked for by the shipwrecked,—O my Dark,</span>
<span class="i0">My Cloud,—to go before me every day</span>
<span class="i0">While I go ever toward the wilderness,—</span>
<span class="i0">I would that you could see me bare to the soul!—</span>
<span class="i0">If this be pity, ’tis so for myself,</span>
<span class="i0">And not for Romney: <i>he</i> can stand alone;</span>
<span class="i0">A man like <i>him</i> is never overcome:</span>
<span class="i0">No woman like me, counts him pitiable</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While saints applaud him. He mistook the world:</span>
<span class="i0">But I mistook my own heart,—and that slip</span>
<span class="i0">Was fatal. Romney,—will you leave me here?</span>
<span class="i0">So wrong, so proud, so weak, so unconsoled,</span>
<span class="i0">So mere a woman!—and I love you so,—</span>
<span class="i0">I love you, Romney.’</span>
<span class="i17">Could I see his face,</span>
<span class="i0">I wept so? Did I drop against his breast,</span>
<span class="i0">Or did his arms constrain me? Were my cheeks</span>
<span class="i0">Hot, overflooded, with my tears, or his?</span>
<span class="i0">And which of our two large explosive hearts</span>
<span class="i0">So shook me? That, I know not. There were words</span>
<span class="i0">That broke in utterance ... melted, in the fire;</span>
<span class="i0">Embrace, that was convulsion, ... then a kiss ...</span>
<span class="i0">As long and silent as the ecstatic night,—And</span>
<span class="i0">deep, deep, shuddering breaths, which meant beyond</span>
<span class="i0">Whatever could be told by word or kiss.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But what he said ... I have written day by day,</span>
<span class="i0">With somewhat even writing. Did I think</span>
<span class="i0">That such a passionate rain would intercept</span>
<span class="i0">And dash this last page? What he said, indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">I fain would write it down here like the rest,</span>
<span class="i0">To keep it in my eyes, as in my ears,</span>
<span class="i0">The heart’s sweet scripture, to be read at night</span>
<span class="i0">When weary, or at morning when afraid,</span>
<span class="i0">And lean my heaviest oath on when I swear</span>
<span class="i0">That, when all’s done, all tried; all counted here,</span>
<span class="i0">All great arts, and all good philosophies,—</span>
<span class="i0">This love just puts its hand out in a dream,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And straight outreaches all things.</span>
<span class="i30">What he said,</span>
<span class="i0">I fain would write. But if an angel spoke</span>
<span class="i0">In thunder, should we, haply, know much more</span>
<span class="i0">Than that it thundered? If a cloud came down</span>
<span class="i0">And wrapt us wholly, could we draw its shape,</span>
<span class="i0">As if on the outside, and not overcome?</span>
<span class="i0">And so he spake. His breath against my face</span>
<span class="i0">Confused his words, yet made them more intense,—</span>
<span class="i0">As when the sudden finder of the wind</span>
<span class="i0">Will wipe a row of single city-lamps</span>
<span class="i0">To a pure white line of flame, more luminous</span>
<span class="i0">Because of obliteration; more intense,—</span>
<span class="i0">The intimate presence carrying in itself</span>
<span class="i0">Complete communication, as with souls</span>
<span class="i0">Who, having put the body off, perceive</span>
<span class="i0">Through simply being. Thus, ’twas granted me</span>
<span class="i0">To know he loved me to the depth and height</span>
<span class="i0">Of such large natures, ever competent</span>
<span class="i0">With grand horizons by the land or sea,</span>
<span class="i0">To love’s grand sunrise. Small spheres hold small fires:</span>
<span class="i0">But he loved largely, as a man can love</span>
<span class="i0">Who, baffled in his love, dares live his life,</span>
<span class="i0">Accept the ends which God loves, for his own,</span>
<span class="i0">And lift a constant aspect.</span>
<span class="i23">From the day</span>
<span class="i0">I had brought to England my poor searching face,</span>
<span class="i0">(An orphan even of my father’s grave)</span>
<span class="i0">He had loved me, watched me, watched his soul in mine,</span>
<span class="i0">Which in me grew and heightened into love.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For he, a boy still, had been told the tale</span>
<span class="i0">Of how a fairy bride from Italy,</span>
<span class="i0">With smells of oleanders in her hair,</span>
<span class="i0">Was coming through the vines to touch his hand;</span>
<span class="i0">Whereat the blood of boyhood on the palm</span>
<span class="i0">Made sudden heats. And when at last I came,</span>
<span class="i0">And lived before him, lived, and rarely smiled,</span>
<span class="i0">He smiled and loved me for the thing I was,</span>
<span class="i0">As every child will love the year’s first flower,</span>
<span class="i0">(Not certainly the fairest of the year,</span>
<span class="i0">But, in which, the complete year seems to blow)</span>
<span class="i0">The poor sad snowdrop,—growing between drifts,</span>
<span class="i0">Mysterious medium ’twixt the plant and frost,</span>
<span class="i0">So faint with winter while so quick with spring,</span>
<span class="i0">So doubtful if to thaw itself away</span>
<span class="i0">With that snow near it. Not that Romney Leigh</span>
<span class="i0">Had loved me coldly. If I thought so once,</span>
<span class="i0">It was as if I had held my hand in fire</span>
<span class="i0">And shook for cold. But now I understood</span>
<span class="i0">For ever, that the very fire and heat</span>
<span class="i0">Of troubling passion in him, burned him clear,</span>
<span class="i0">And shaped to dubious order, word and act:</span>
<span class="i0">That, just because he loved me over all,</span>
<span class="i0">All wealth, all lands, all social privilege,</span>
<span class="i0">To which chance made him unexpected heir,—</span>
<span class="i0">And, just because on all these lesser gifts,</span>
<span class="i0">Constrained by conscience and the sense of wrong</span>
<span class="i0">He had stamped with steady hand God’s arrow-mark</span>
<span class="i0">Of dedication to the human need,</span>
<span class="i0">He thought it should be so too, with his love;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He, passionately loving, would bring down</span>
<span class="i0">His love, his life, his best, (because the best)</span>
<span class="i0">His bride of dreams, who walked so still and high</span>
<span class="i0">Through flowery poems as through meadow-grass,</span>
<span class="i0">The dust of golden lilies on her feet,</span>
<span class="i0">That <i>she</i> should walk beside him on the rocks</span>
<span class="i0">In all that clang and hewing out of men,</span>
<span class="i0">And help the work of help which was his life,</span>
<span class="i0">And prove he kept back nothing,—not his soul.</span>
<span class="i0">And when I failed him,—for I failed him, I—</span>
<span class="i0">And when it seemed he had missed my love,—he thought,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Aurora makes room for a working-noon;’</span>
<span class="i0">And so, self-girded with torn strips of hope,</span>
<span class="i0">Took up his life, as if it were for death,</span>
<span class="i0">(Just capable of one heroic aim,)</span>
<span class="i0">And threw it in the thickest of the world,—</span>
<span class="i0">At which men laughed as if he had drowned a dog:</span>
<span class="i0">No wonder,—since Aurora failed him first!</span>
<span class="i0">The morning and the evening made his day.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But oh, the night! oh, bitter-sweet! oh, sweet!</span>
<span class="i0">O dark, O moon and stars, O ecstasy</span>
<span class="i0">Of darkness! O great mystery of love,—</span>
<span class="i0">In which absorbed, loss, anguish, treason’s self</span>
<span class="i0">Enlarges rapture,—as a pebble dropt</span>
<span class="i0">In some full wine-cup, over-brims the wine!</span>
<span class="i0">While we two sate together, leaned that night</span>
<span class="i0">So close, my very garments crept and thrilled</span>
<span class="i0">With strange electric life; and both my cheeks</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Grew red, then pale, with touches from my hair</span>
<span class="i0">In which his breath was; while the golden moon</span>
<span class="i0">Was hung before our faces as the badge</span>
<span class="i0">Of some sublime inherited despair,</span>
<span class="i0">Since ever to be seen by only one,—</span>
<span class="i0">A voice said, low and rapid as a sigh,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet breaking, I felt conscious, from a smile,—</span>
<span class="i0">‘Thank God, who made me blind, to make me see!</span>
<span class="i0">Shine on, Aurora, dearest light of souls,</span>
<span class="i0">Which rul’st for evermore both day and night!</span>
<span class="i0">I am happy.’</span>
<span class="i12">I flung closer to his breast,</span>
<span class="i0">As sword that, after battle, flings to sheathe;</span>
<span class="i0">And, in that hurtle of united souls,</span>
<span class="i0">The mystic motions which in common moods</span>
<span class="i0">Are shut beyond our sense, broke in on us,</span>
<span class="i0">And, as we sate, we felt the old earth spin,</span>
<span class="i0">And all the starry turbulence of worlds</span>
<span class="i0">Swing round us in their audient circles, till</span>
<span class="i0">If that same golden moon were overhead</span>
<span class="i0">Or if beneath our feet, we did not know.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then calm, equal, smooth with weights of joy,</span>
<span class="i0">His voice rose, as some chief musician’s song</span>
<span class="i0">Amid the old Jewish temple’s Selah-pause,</span>
<span class="i0">And bade me mark how we two met at last</span>
<span class="i0">Upon this moon-bathed promontory of earth,</span>
<span class="i0">To give up much on each side, then take all.</span>
<span class="i0">‘Beloved,’ it sang, ‘we must be here to work;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And men who work, can only work for men,</span>
<span class="i0">And, not to work in vain, must comprehend</span>
<span class="i0">Humanity, and, so, work humanly,</span>
<span class="i0">And raise men’s bodies still by raising souls,</span>
<span class="i0">As God did, first.’</span>
<span class="i16">‘But stand upon the earth,’</span>
<span class="i0">I said, ‘to raise them,—(this is human too;</span>
<span class="i0">There’s nothing high which has not first been low;</span>
<span class="i0">My humbleness, said One, has made me great!)</span>
<span class="i0">As God did, last.’</span>
<span class="i16">‘And work all silently,</span>
<span class="i0">And simply,’ he returned, ‘as God does all;</span>
<span class="i0">Distort our nature never, for our work,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor count our right hands stronger for being hoofs.</span>
<span class="i0">The man most man, with tenderest human hands,</span>
<span class="i0">Works best for men,—as God in Nazareth.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He paused upon the word, and then resumed;</span>
<span class="i0">‘Fewer programmes; we who have no prescience.</span>
<span class="i0">Fewer systems; we who are held and do not hold.</span>
<span class="i0">Less mapping out of masses, to be saved,</span>
<span class="i0">By nations or by sexes. Fourier’s void,</span>
<span class="i0">And Comte is dwarfed,—and Cabet, puerile.</span>
<span class="i0">Subsists no law of life outside of life;</span>
<span class="i0">No perfect manners, without Christian souls:</span>
<span class="i0">The Christ himself had been no Lawgiver,</span>
<span class="i0">Unless He had given the life, too, with the law.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I echoed thoughtfully—‘The man, most man,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Works best for men: and, if most man indeed,</span>
<span class="i0">He gets his manhood plainest from his soul:</span>
<span class="i0">While, obviously, this stringent soul itself</span>
<span class="i0">Obeys our old rules of development;</span>
<span class="i0">The Spirit ever witnessing in ours,</span>
<span class="i0">And Love, the soul of soul, within the soul,</span>
<span class="i0">Evolving it sublimely. First, God’s love.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘And next,’ he smiled, ‘the love of wedded souls,</span>
<span class="i0">Which still presents that mystery’s counterpart.</span>
<span class="i0">Sweet shadow-rose, upon the water of life,</span>
<span class="i0">Of such a mystic substance, Sharon gave</span>
<span class="i0">A name to! human, vital, fructuous rose,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose calyx holds the multitude of leaves,—</span>
<span class="i0">Loves filial, loves fraternal, neighbour-loves,</span>
<span class="i0">And civic, ... all fair petals, all good scents,</span>
<span class="i0">All reddened, sweetened from one central Heart!’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Alas,’ I cried, ‘it was not long ago,</span>
<span class="i0">You swore this very social rose smelt ill.’</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Alas,’ he answered, ‘is it a rose at all?</span>
<span class="i0">The filial’s thankless, the fraternal’s hard,</span>
<span class="i0">The rest is lost. I do but stand and think,</span>
<span class="i0">Across dim waters of a troubled life</span>
<span class="i0">The Flower of Heaven so vainly overhangs,—</span>
<span class="i0">What perfect counterpart would be in sight,</span>
<span class="i0">If tanks were clearer. Let us clean the tubes,</span>
<span class="i0">And wait for rains. O poet, O my love,</span>

<span class="i0">Since <i>I</i> was too ambitious in my deed,</span>
<span class="i0">And thought to distance all men in success,</span>
<span class="i0">Till God came on me, marked the place, and said,</span>
<span class="i0">‘Ill-doer, henceforth keep within this line,</span>
<span class="i0">Attempting less than others,’—and I stand</span>
<span class="i0">And work among Christ’s little ones, content,—</span>
<span class="i0">Come thou, my compensation, my dear sight,</span>
<span class="i0">My morning-star, my morning! rise and shine,</span>
<span class="i0">And touch my hills with radiance not their own;</span>

<span class="i0">Gaze on, with inscient vision toward the sun,</span>

<span class="i0">A silver key is given to thy clasp,</span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt stand unwearied, night and day,</span>
<span class="i0">And fix it in the hard, slow-turning wards,</span>
<span class="i0">And open, so, that intermediate door</span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the different planes of sensuous form</span>
<span class="i0">And form insensuous, that inferior men</span>
<span class="i0">May learn to feel on still through these to those,</span>
<span class="i0">And bless thy ministration. The world waits</span>
<span class="i0">For help. Beloved, let us love so well,</span>
<span class="i0">Our work shall still be better for our love,</span>
<span class="i0">And still our love be sweeter for our work,</span>
<span class="i0">And both, commended, for the sake of each,</span>
<span class="i0">By all true workers and true lovers born.</span>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
